PLAYING WITH FIRE.

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
MERLWOOD.
</h3>

<p>
''Pon my word, cousin, I think I should actually fall in love
with you, but that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What?' asked the girl, with a curious smile.
</p>

<p>
'One so seldom falls in love with one they have known
for a life long.'
</p>

<p>
The girl sighed softly, and said, still smiling sweetly:
</p>

<p>
'Looking upon her as almost a sister, you mean, Roland.'
</p>

<p>
'Or almost as a brother, as the case may be.'
</p>

<p>
'Then how about Paul and Virginia?  They knew each
other all their lives, and yet loved each other tenderly.'
</p>

<p>
'Or desperately, rather, Hester; but that was in an old
story book greatly appreciated by our grandmothers.'
</p>

<p>
'Instead of talking nonsense here, I really think you
should go home, Roland,' said the girl, with a tone of pain
and pique at his nonchalant manner; 'home for a time, at
least.'
</p>

<p>
'To Earlshaugh?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Are you tired of me already, Hester?'
</p>

<p>
'Tired of you, Roland?&mdash;oh, no,' replied the girl softly,
while playing with the petals of a flower.
</p>

<p>
The speakers were Roland Lindsay, a young captain of
the line, home on leave from Egypt, and his cousin, Hester
Maule, a handsome girl in her eighteenth year; and the
scene in which they figured was a shady, green and
well-wooded grassy bank that sloped down to the Esk, in front of
the pretty villa of Merlwood, where he swung lazily in a net
hammock between two beautiful laburnum-trees, smoking a
cigar, while she sat on the turf close by, with a fan of
peacock feathers in her slim and pretty hand, dispersing the
midges that were swarming under the trees in the hot
sunshine of an August evening.
</p>

<p>
While the heedless fellow who swung there, enjoying his
cigar and his hammock, and the charm of the whole situation,
twitted her with her unconcern, Hester&mdash;we need not
conceal the fact&mdash;loved him with a love that now formed
part of her daily existence; while he accorded her in return
the half-careless affection of a brother, or as yet little more.
</p>

<p>
At his father's house of Earlshaugh, at his uncle's villa of
Merlwood, and elsewhere, till he had joined his regiment,
they had been brought up together, and together had shared
all the pleasures and amusements of childhood.  In the
thick woods of Earlshaugh, and along the sylvan banks of
the Esk, in the glorious summer and autumn days, it had
been their delight to clamber into thick and leafy bowers&mdash;vast
and mysterious retreats to them&mdash;where, with the birds
around them, and the flowers, the ivy, and the ferns
beneath their feet, they wove fairy caps of rushes and conned
their tasks, often with cheek laid against cheek and ringlets
intermingled; and in their days of childhood Roland had
often told her tales of what they would do and where they
would go when they became man and wife, and little
Hester wondered at the story he wove, as it seemed
impossible that they could ever be happier than they were
then.  He always preferred her as a companion and playmate
to his only sister Maude, greatly to the indignation of
that young lady.
</p>

<p>
She had borne her part in many of Roland's boyish
pastimes, even to spinning tops and playing marbles, until
the days came when they cantered together on their sturdy
little Shetlands through Melville Woods and by the braes
of Woodhouselee, or where Earlshaugh looked down on the
pastoral expanse near Leuchars and Balmullo, in the East
Neuk of Fife.
</p>

<p>
When the time came that Roland had inexorably to go
forth into the world and join his regiment, poor Hester
Maule wept in secret as if her heart would have burst; while
he&mdash;with all a boy's ardour for his red coat and the new
and brilliant life before him&mdash;bade her farewell with
provoking equanimity and wonderful philosophy; and now that
he had come back, and she&mdash;in the dignity of her eighteen
years&mdash;could no longer aid him in birdnesting (if he thought
of such a thing), or holding a wicket for him, she had&mdash;during
the few weeks he had been at home&mdash;felt her girl's
heart go back to the sweet old days and the starting-point,
which he seemed to have almost forgotten, or scarcely
referred to.
</p>

<p>
And yet, when she came along the grassy bank, and
tossed her garden hat aside on seating herself on the grass
near him, there was something in her bearing then which
haunted him in after-years&mdash;a shy, unconscious grace in all
her movements, a flush on her soft cheek, a bright
expression in her clear and innocent eyes, brightened
apparently by the flickering shadows that fell between the
leaves upon her uncovered head, and flushed her white
summer dress with touches of bright colour; and looking at
him archly, she began, as if almost to herself, to sing a song
she had been wont to sing long ago&mdash;an old song to the
older air of the 'Bonnie Briar Bush':
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The visions of the buried past<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come thronging, dearer far<br />
  Than joys the present hour can give,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than present objects are&mdash;&mdash;'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Go on, Hester,' said Roland, as she paused.
</p>

<p>
'No,' said she with a little <i>moue</i>, 'you don't care for
these old memories now.'
</p>

<p>
'When soldiering, Hester, we have to keep our minds so
much in the present that, by Jove! a fellow has not much
time for brooding over the past.'
</p>

<p>
Hester made no reply, but cast down her lashes, and proceeded
to roll and unroll the ribbons of her hat round her
slender fingers.
</p>

<p>
Roland Lindsay manipulated another cigar, lit it leisurely,
and relapsed into silence too.
</p>

<p>
He was a remarkably good-looking young fellow, and
perhaps one who knew himself to be so, having been somewhat
spoiled by ladies already.  Though not quite regular,
his features were striking, and&mdash;like his bearing&mdash;impressed
those who did not know him well with a high opinion of his
strength of character, which was not great, we must admit,
in some respects; though his chin was well defined and even
square, as shown by his being closely shaven all save a
carefully trimmed dark moustache.
</p>

<p>
His grayish hazel eyes looked almost black at night, and
were expressive and keen yet soft.  In figure he was well
set up&mdash;the drill-sergeant had done that; and unmistakably
he was a manly-looking fellow in his twenty-seventh year,
dressed in a plain yet irreproachably-made tweed suit of
light gray that well became his dark and dusky complexion,
with spotlessly white cuffs and tie, and a tweed stalking-cap
peaked before and behind.  He had an air of well-bred
nonchalance, of being perfectly at home; and now you have
him&mdash;Captain Roland Lindsay of Her Majesty's Infantry,
with a face and neck burned red and blistered by the
fierce sun of Egypt and the Soudan.
</p>

<p>
Merlwood, the house of Hester's father, which he was now
favouring with a protracted visit, is situated on the north
bank of the Esk, and was so named as being the favourite
haunt of the blackbird, whose voice was heard amid its
thickets in the earliest spring, as that of the throstle was
heard not far off in the adjacent birks of Mavis-wood on the
opposite side of that river, which, from its source in the hills
of Peebles till it joins the sea at Musselburgh, displays
sylvan beauties of which no other stream in Scotland can
boast&mdash;the beauties of which Scott sang so skilfully in one
of his best ballads:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Sweet are the paths, O, passing sweet!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Esk's fair streams that run<br />
  O'er airy steep, through copsewood deep,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impervious to the sun,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'From that fair dome where suit is paid,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By blast of bugle free,<br />
  To Auchindinny's hazel shade,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And haunted Woodhouselee,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Who knows not Melville's beechy grove<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roslin's rocky glen,<br />
  Dalkeith, which all the virtues love,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And classic Hawthornden?<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Embosomed amid the beautiful scenery here, the handsome
modern villa of Merlwood, with its Swiss roof and plate-glass
oriel windows half smothered amid wild roses, clematis, and
jasmine, crowned a bank where the dreamy and ceaseless
murmur of the Esk was ever heard; and in the cosy if not
stately rooms of which old Sir Harry Maule, K.C.B., a retired
Lieutenant-General, and the veteran of more than one Indian
war, had stored up the mementoes of his stirring past&mdash;the
tusky skulls, striped skins, and giant claws of more than one
man-eating tiger, trophies of his breechloader; and those of
other Indian conflicts at Lucknow, Jhansi, and elsewhere, in
the shape of buffalo shields, tulwars, inlaid Afghan juzails,
battle axes, and deadly khandjurs, with gorgeous trappings
for horse and elephant.
</p>

<p>
And picturesque looked the home of the old soldier and
his only daughter Hester, as seen in the August sunshine,
at that season when autumn peeps stealthily through the
openings made in thicket and hedge, when the sweet may-buds
are dead and gone, the feathered grasses are cut down,
but the ferns and the ivy yet cover all the rocks of the Esk,
and flowering creepers connect the trees; the blue hare-bell
still peeped out, and in waste places the ox-eye daisy and
the light scarlet poppy were lingering still, for August is a
month flushed with the last touches of summer, and though
the latter was past and gone, those warm tints which make
the Scottish woods so peculiarly lovely in autumn had not
yet begun to mellow or temper the varied greenery of the
bosky valley of rocks and timber through which the
mountain Esk flows to the Firth of Forth.
</p>

<p>
To the eyes of Roland Lindsay, how still and green and
cool it all seemed, after the arid sands, the breathless
atmosphere, and the scorching heat of Southern Egypt!
</p>

<p>
'By Jove, there is no place like home!' thought he, and
he tossed out of his hammock <i>Punch</i>, the <i>Graphic</i>, and
Clery's 'Minor Tactics,' with which he had been killing
time, till his fair cousin joined him; and with his cigar alight,
his stalking cap tilted forward over his eyes, his hands
behind his head, he swung to and fro in the full enjoyment
of lazy indolence.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
HESTER MAULE.
</h3>

<p>
Though the life of Hester Maule at Merlwood was a somewhat
secluded one, as she had no mother to act as chaperone,
it was not one of inaction.  Her mornings were generally
spent in charitable work among poor people in the nearest
village, visiting the old and sick, sometimes in scolding and
teaching the young, assisting the minister in many ways with
local charities, and often winding up the evening by a brisk
game of lawn-tennis with his young folks at the manse, and
now and then a ball or a carpet dance at some adjacent
house, when late hours never prevented her from being down
from her room in the morning, as gay as a mavis or merle,
to pour out her father's coffee, cut and air his paper, or
attend to his hookah, the use of which the old Anglo-Indian
had not yet been able to relinquish.
</p>

<p>
Now the girl had become shy or dry in manner, piqued
and silent certainly, to her cousin; for, in mortifying
contrast to her silent thoughts, she was pondering over his
off-hand speech with which the preceding chapter opens; thus
even he found it somewhat difficult to carry on a one-sided
conversation with the back of her averted head, however
handsome, with its large coil of dark and glossy hair turned
to him.
</p>

<p>
Roland liked and more than admired his graceful cousin,
and now, perhaps suspecting that his nonchalant manner
was scarcely 'the thing' and finding her silent, even
frosty in manner, he said:
</p>

<p>
'Hester, will you listen to me now?'
</p>

<p>
'That depends upon what you have to say, Roland.'
</p>

<p>
'I never say anything wrong, so don't be cross, my
dear little one.'
</p>

<p>
'He treats me as a child still!' she thought in anger,
and said sharply:
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'Shall we go along the river bank and see the trout
rising?'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;it is certainly better than doing nothing.'
</p>

<p>
'But is useless,' said she coldly.
</p>

<p>
'Why?  It is now my turn to ask.'
</p>

<p>
'Because you know very well, or ought to know, that
there are none to be seen after June, and that the mills
have ruined angling hereabout.'
</p>

<p>
'Let us look for ferns, then&mdash;there are forty different
kinds, I believe, in Roslin Glen.'
</p>

<p>
'Ferns&mdash;how can you be so childish, Roland!' exclaimed
the girl with growing pique, as she thought&mdash;'If
he has aught to say of more interest, surely he can say it
here,' and she kept her eyes averted, looking down the
wooded glen through which the river brawled, with her
heart full of affection and love, which her cousin was
singularly slow to see; then furtively she looked at him
once or twice, as he lounged on his back, smoking and
gazing upward at the patches of blue sky seen through the
interlaced branches of the overarching trees.
</p>

<p>
'Gentleman' was stamped on every feature and in
every action of Lindsay, and there was an easy and quiet
deliberation in all he did and said that indicated good
breeding, and yet he had a bearing in his figure and aspect
in his dark face that would have become Millais' 'Black
Brunswicker.'
</p>

<p>
Hester Maule is difficult to describe; but if the reader
will think of the prettiest girl she or he ever saw, they have
a general idea of her attractions.
</p>

<p>
A proud and stately yet most graceful-looking girl, Hester
had a lissom figure a trifle over the middle height, hair of
the richest and deepest brown, dark violet-coloured and
velvety-like eyes with full lids, long lashes, and brows that
were black; a dazzling complexion, a beautiful smile when
pleased, and hands and feet that showed race and breeding
beyond all doubt.
</p>

<p>
Roland was quite aware that Hester was no longer a child,
but a girl almost out of her teens, and one that looked older
than her years.  He had seen her at intervals, and seen how
she had grown up and expanded into the handsome girl she
had become&mdash;one of whom any kinsman might be proud;
and with all his seeming indifference and doubt of his true
emotions, it was evident now that propinquity might do
much; and times there were when he began to feel for her
some of that tender interest and admiration which generally
form a sure prelude to love.  Moreover, they were cousins,
and 'there is no denying that cousinship covers a multitude
of things within its kindly mantle.'
</p>

<p>
Hester was the only daughter of his maternal uncle, the
old General, whose services had won him a K.C.B.&mdash;an
improvident and somewhat impoverished man, who for
years had been a kind of invalid from ailments contracted
after the great Indian Mutiny&mdash;chiefly from a bullet lodged
in his body at Jhansi, when he fought under the famous
Sir Hugh Rose&mdash;Lord Strathnairn in later years.
</p>

<p>
She was the one 'ewe lamb' of his flock, all of whom
were lying by their mother's side under the trees in the old
kirkyard of Lasswade, within sound of the murmuring Esk;
and though the charm of Hester's society had been one of
the chief reasons that induced Roland Lindsay to linger at
Merlwood, as he had done for nearly a month past, he was
loth to adopt the idea now being involved therein.  Such is
the inconsistency of the male heart at times; and he,
perhaps, misconstrued, or attributed his emotion to compassion
for her apparently lonely life and somewhat dubious future&mdash;for
Sir Henry's life was precarious; and in this perilous
and dubious state matters were now, while Roland's leave of
absence was running on.
</p>

<p>
Not that the latter was extremely limited.  To the
uninitiated we may mention that what is technically termed
winter leave extends generally from the 15th October to the
14th of the following March, 'when all officers are to be
present with their respective regiments and depôts;' but
Roland had extended or more ample leave accorded him
than this, owing to the sufferings he had undergone from a
wound and fever when with the army of occupation in
Egypt, a portion of which his regiment formed&mdash;hence it
was that August saw him at Merlwood.
</p>

<p>
And now we may briefly state how he was situated, and
some of the 'features' on which his future 'hinged.'
</p>

<p>
During his absence with the army his father, the old
fox-hunting Laird of Earlshaugh, a widower, after the death of
Roland's mother had rashly married her companion, a
handsome but artful woman, who, at his death (caused by a
fall in the hunting-field, after which she had nursed him
assiduously), was left by him, through his will, all that he
possessed in land, estate, and heritage, without control;
but never doubting&mdash;poor silly man&mdash;that she would do full
justice in the end to his only son and daughter, as a species
of mother, monitress, and guardian&mdash;a risk the eventualities
of which he had not quite foreseen, as we shall show in the
time to come.
</p>

<p>
But so it was; his father, who, at one time, he thought,
would hardly have rested in his grave if the acres of
Earlshaugh and the turrets of the old mansion had gone out of
the family, in which they had been since Sir James Lindsay
of Edzell and Glenesk fell by his royal master's side at
Flodden, had been weak enough to do this monstrous piece
of injustice, under the influence of an artful and designing
woman!
</p>

<p>
It was an injury so galling, so miserable, and&mdash;to Roland
Lindsay&mdash;so scarcely realizable, that he had been in no
haste to return to his ancestral home.
</p>

<p>
And hence, perhaps, he had lingered at Merlwood, where
his uncle, Sir Harry, who hated, defied, and utterly failed to
understand anything of the 'outs and ins' of law or lawyers,
including wills and bequests, etc., etc., fed his natural
indignation by anathematizing the artful Jezebel of a
step-mother; and declaring that he never did and never would
believe in her; and adjusting himself as well as that cursed
'Jhansi bullet' would allow him, while lounging back in his
long, low, and spacious Singapore chair, he would suck his
hookah viciously, and roundly assert, as a crowning iniquity,
that he was certain she had 'at least four annas to the rupee
in her blood!'

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
KASHGATE&mdash;A RETROSPECT.
</h3>

<p>
It was pretty clear, on the whole, to Hester, that her
cousin, Roland Lindsay, thought but little of the past, and
perhaps, as a general rule, cared for it even less.  While she
had been living on the memory of these dear days, especially
since this&mdash;his last return home&mdash;he had allowed other
events to obliterate it from his mind.
</p>

<p>
Let us take a little retrospect.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to the apparently languid and <i>blasé</i> smoker,
swinging in his net hammock, enjoying the balmy evening
breeze by the wooded Esk, and dallying with a girl of more
than ordinary loveliness, let us imagine him in a dusty and
blood-stained tunic, with a battered tropical helmet, a beard
unshaven for many a day, haggard in visage, wild-eyed and
full of soldierly enthusiasm, one of the leading actors in a
scene like the following, at the fatal and most disastrous
battle of Kashgate.
</p>

<p>
It was the evening of the 3rd November in an arid waste
of the Soudan&mdash;sand, sand everywhere&mdash;not a well to
yield a drop of brackish water, not a tree to give the slightest
shade.  The heat was awful, beyond all parallel and all
European conception, well-nigh beyond endurance, and the
doomed soldiers of General Hicks&mdash;known as Hicks Pasha&mdash;a
veteran of the famous old Bombay Fusiliers who had
served at Magdala, and to whose staff Roland Lindsay, then
a subaltern, was attached, toiled on, over the dry and arid
desert steppe that lies between El Duem and El Obeid, in
search of the troops of the ubiquitous Mahdi&mdash;the gallant
Hicks and his few British officers training their loosely and
hastily constituted Egyptian army to operations in the field,
even while advancing against one, said to be three hundred
thousand strong&mdash;doubtless an Oriental exaggeration&mdash;but
strong enough nevertheless, as the event proved, to sweep
their miserable soldiers off the face of the earth, in that
battle, the details of which will never be known till the
Last Day, as only one or two escaped.
</p>

<p>
Like Colonel Farquhar of the Guards, Majors Warren,
Martin and other British officers, Roland Lindsay, by his
personal example, had done all that in him lay to cheer the
weak-limbed and faint-hearted Egyptian soldiers, whose
almost sable visages were now gaunt and hollow, and whose
white tunics and scarlet tarbooshes were tattered and worn by
their long and toilsome march through the terrible country
westward of the White Nile&mdash;a vast steppe covered with low
thorny trees, purple mimosa, gum bushes, and spiky grass,
till the sad, solemn, and desert waste was reached near
Kashgate, where all&mdash;save one or two&mdash;were to find their
graves!
</p>

<p>
Mounted on a splendid Arab, whose rider he had slain in
the battle of the 29th of April, Roland Lindsay led one face
of the hollow square in which the troops marched, and in
which formation they fought for three days, with baggage,
sick and wounded in the centre, Krupp and Nordenfeldt
guns in the angles, against a dark and surging human sea of
frantic Dervishes, wild Bedouins, and equally wild and
savage Mohammedans and Mulattoes, shrieking, yelling,
armed with ponderous swords and deadly spears that flashed
like thousands of mirrors in the sunshine.
</p>

<p>
The Dervishes came on, the foremost and most fearless,
sent by the Mahdi, Mahommed Achmet Shemseddin, who
had declared that they must vanquish all, as they had the
aid of Heaven, of the Prophet and his legions of unseen
angels, as at the battle of Bedr, when he conquered the
Koreish.
</p>

<p>
Wild and desperate was the prolonged fighting, the
Egyptians knowing that no mercy would be accorded to
them, and fearful was the slaughter, till the sand was soaked
with blood&mdash;till the worn-out square was utterly broken, its
living walls dashed to pieces, and hurled against each other
under the feet of the victorious Mahdists.
</p>

<p>
In vain did young Lindsay, like other Britons who followed
Hicks, endeavour to make some of their men front about;
calling on them, sword and revolver in hand, as they flung
themselves on the sand now in despair, face downwards, and
perished miserably under sword and spear, or fled in abject
and uncontrollable terror; but in the end he found himself
abandoned, and had to hack his way out of the press
through a forest of weapons till he reached the side of
General Hicks, who was making a last and desperate charge
at the head of his staff alone!
</p>

<p>
Side by side, with a ringing and defiant cheer, these few
Britons galloped against the living flood that was led by a
sheikh in brilliant floating robes.
</p>

<p>
'He is the Mahdi&mdash;he is the Mahdi!' cried Lindsay, and
such Hicks and all who followed him supposed that sheikh,
but in mistake, to be.
</p>

<p>
He was splendidly mounted, and in addition to his
Mahdi surcoat and floating robes wore a glittering Dharfour
helmet, with a tippet of chain-mail and a long shirt of the
same defensive material.  Through this the sword of Hicks
gave him a deadly cut in the arm, and his sword-hand
dropped, but with the other he contrived to hurl a club,
which unhorsed the General, who was then slain; but the
mailed warrior, who looked like a Crusader of the twelfth
century, was hewn down by Roland through helmet and
head to the chin, and just as he fell above Hicks all the
staff perished then on foot, their horses being speared or
hamstrung&mdash;all gallant and resolute soldiers, Fraser,
Farquhar, Brodie, Walker, and others&mdash;fighting back to back
or in a desperate circle.
</p>

<p>
One moment Roland saw the last of them, erect in all
the pride and strength of manhood, inspired by courage and
despair&mdash;his cheeks flushed, his eyes flashing, while handling
his sword with all the conscious pride of race and skill;
and the next he lay stretched and bleeding on the heap
beside him, with the pallor in his face of one who would
never rise again.
</p>

<p>
In that <i>mêlée</i> no less than three Emirs of the False
Prophet fell under the sword of Lindsay, who cut his way
out and escaped alone; and spattered with blood from the
slain, as well as from two sword-wounds in his own body,
spurred rearward his horse, which had many a gash and
stab, but carried him clear out of the field and onward till
darkness fell, and he found himself alone&mdash;alone in the
desert.  There the whitening skeleton of more than one
camel&mdash;the relic of a caravan&mdash;lay; and there the
huge Egyptian vultures ('Pharaoh's chickens,' as they are
called), with their fierce beaks, great eyes, and ample wings,
were floating overhead on their way to the field, for the
unburied slain attract these flocks from a wonderful
distance.
</p>

<p>
When his horse sank down, Lindsay remained beside it,
helpless and weary, awaiting the blood-red dawn of the
Nubian sun.
</p>

<p>
As he lay there under the stars that glittered out of the
blue sky like points of steel, many a memory of the past,
of vanished faces, once familiar and still loved; of his home
at Earlshaugh, with its wealth of wood and hill; and
recollections which had been growing misty and indistinct
came before him with many a scene and episode, like
dissolving views that melted each other, as he seemed to
himself to sink into sleep&mdash;the sleep that was born of
fatigue, long over-tension of the nerves, and loss of blood.
</p>

<p>
For weeks he was returned as one of the slain who had
perished at Kashgate; but Roland was hard to kill.  He
had reached Khartoum&mdash;how he scarcely knew&mdash;ere Gordon,
the betrayed and abandoned by England, had perished
there; and eventually regained the headquarters of his
regiment, then with the army of occupation in Lower
Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Of all this, and much more, with reference to her cousin
had Hester Maule read in the public prints; but little or
nothing of his adventures in the East could she glean from
him, as he seemed very diffident and loth to speak of himself,
unlike her father, Sir Harry, who was never weary of his
reminiscences of the war in Central India, particularly the
siege and capture of Jhansi under Lord Strathnairn, of
gallant memory.
</p>

<p>
So the bearing of Roland Lindsay at the battle of Kashgate
and elsewhere had proved that he was worthy of the old
historic line from which he sprang; and that there was a
latent fire, energy, and spirit of the highest kind under his
calm, easy, and pleasant exterior.
</p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
PLAYING WITH FIRE.
</h3>

<p>
And now, a few days subsequently, while idling after dinner
over coffee and a cigar, with his pretty cousin and Sir
Harry, in the latter's study, a little room set apart by him for
his own delectation, where he could always find his tobacco
jars, the Army Lists, East Indian Registers, and so forth,
ready at hand&mdash;a 'study' hung round with whips and spurs,
fishing and shooting gear, a few old swords, and furnished
with Singapore chairs, tiger skins, and a couple of teapoys,
or little tables, Roland Lindsay obtained a little more
insight into family matters that had transpired daring his
absence while soldiering against the False Prophet in the
East.
</p>

<p>
Sir Harry was a tall and handsome man, nearer his
seventieth than his sixtieth year, with regular aquiline
features, keen gray eyes, and closely shaven, all save a heavy
moustache, which was, like his hair, silver white; and
though somewhat feebler now by long Indian service and
wounds, he looked every inch, an aristocratic old soldier and
gently but decidedly he spoke to his nephew of troubles
ahead, while Hester's white hands were busy among her
Berlin wools, and she glanced ever and anon furtively, but
with fond interest, at her young kinsman, who apparently
was provokingly unconscious thereof.
</p>

<p>
The old fox-hunting laird, his father, though a free liver,
had never been reckless or profligate; had never squandered
or lost an acre of Earlshaugh; never drank or gambled to
excess, nor been duped by his most boon companions; but
on finding that he was getting too heavy for the saddle, and
that the world, after all, was proving 'flat, stale, and
unprofitable,' had latterly, for a couple of years before his death,
buried himself in the somewhat dull and lonely if stately
mansion of Earlshaugh, where he had for a second time, to
the astonishment of all his friends, those of the Hunt
particularly, betaken himself to matrimony, or been lured
thereinto by his late wife's attractive and, as Sir Harry
phrased it, 'most strategic' and enterprising companion,
who had&mdash;as all the folks in the East Neuk said&mdash;contrived
to 'wind him round her little finger,' by discovering and
sedulously attending to and anticipating all his querulous
wants and wishes; and thus, when he died, it was found that
he had left her&mdash;as already stated&mdash;possessed of all he had
in the world, to the manifest detriment and danger of his
only son and daughter; and, worse still, it would seem that
the widow was now in the hands of one more artful than
herself&mdash;said to be a relation&mdash;one Mr. Hawkey Sharpe, into
whose care and keeping she apparently confided everything.
</p>

<p>
Roland's yearly allowance since he joined the army had
not been meddled with; but deeming himself justly the
entire heir of everything, it could scarcely be thought he
would be content with that alone now.
</p>

<p>
'A black look-out, uncle,' said he grimly; 'so, prior to
my return to Earlshaugh, to be forewarned is to be
fore-armed.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; but in this instance, my boy,' said Sir Harry,
relinquishing for a moment the amber mouthpiece of his
hookah, 'you scarcely know against what or against whom.'
</p>

<p>
'Nor can I, perhaps, until I see a lawyer on the subject.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, d&mdash;n lawyers!  Keep them out of it, if possible.
The letters S.S.C. after a man's name always make me
shiver.'
</p>

<p>
'And who is this Mr. Hawkey Sharpe, who seems to
have installed himself at Earlshaugh?' asked Roland, after a
brief pause.
</p>

<p>
'No one knows but your&mdash;your stepmother,' replied Sir
Harry, with a grimace, as he kicked a hassock from under
his foot.  'No one but she apparently; he seems a sharp
fellow, in whom she trusts implicitly in all regarding the
estate.'
</p>

<p>
'Where did he come from?'
</p>

<p>
'God knows; but he seems to be what our American
cousins deem the acme of 'cuteness.'
</p>

<p>
'And that is&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'A Yankee Jew attorney of English parentage,' replied
Sir Harry, with a kind of smile, in which his nephew did not
join.
</p>

<p>
'Earlshaugh is a fine properly, as we all know, uncle; but
it was deuced hard for me, when I thought I had come into
it, to find this stepmother&mdash;a person I can barely remember
acting as my mother's amanuensis, factotum, and
toady&mdash;constituted a species of guardian to me&mdash;to me, a captain in
my twenty-seventh year, and to be told that I must for the
time content me with my old allowance, as the pater had
been&mdash;she said&mdash;rather extravagant, and so forth.  I can't
make it out.'
</p>

<p>
'Neither can I, nor any other fellow,' said the old General
testily.  'I only know that your father made a very idiotic
will, leaving all to that woman.'
</p>

<p>
'If he actually did so,' said Roland.
</p>

<p>
'No doubt about it&mdash;I heard it read.'
</p>

<p>
'But you are a little deaf, dear uncle.'
</p>

<p>
'D&mdash;n it, don't say that, Roland&mdash;I am fit for service
yet!'
</p>

<p>
'Well, she has not interfered with my allowance as yet.'
</p>

<p>
'Allowance!' exclaimed Sir Harry, smiting the table with
his hand; 'why the devil should you be restricted to one
at all?'
</p>

<p>
'If&mdash;I am very ignorant in law, uncle&mdash;but if under this
will she has the life-rent&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'More than that, I tell you.'
</p>

<p>
'I can scarcely believe it; and she has not meddled with
the allowance of dear little Maude.'
</p>

<p>
'She may cut off your sister's income and yours too at
any moment, Roland!'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I suppose if the worst comes to the worst,' said the
latter, with a kind of bitter laugh, while still hoping against
hope, 'I shall have to send in my papers and volunteer as a
trooper for one of these Cape corps in Bechuanaland or the
Transvaal.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Roland, don't think of such things,' said Hester, as
with tenderness in her eyes she looked up at him for a
moment, and then resumed her work.
</p>

<p>
'Have you seen this stepmother of mine lately?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;but she has invited me to Earlshaugh next month,
not knowing, perhaps, that you would spend the first month
of your leave&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'With his old uncle,' said Sir Harry, as his eyes kindled,
and he patted Roland's shoulder, adding, 'a good lad&mdash;a
good lad&mdash;my own sister's son!'
</p>

<p>
Uncle and nephew had much in common between them,
even 'shop,' as they phrased it; and the regard they had for
each other was mutual and keen.
</p>

<p>
'She writes to me seldom,' said Hester, 'for, of course,
our tastes and ideas are somewhat apart; but, as papa says,
when he sees her stiff note-paper, with the sham gentility of
its gilt and crimson monogram, and strong fragrance of
Essbouquet, he feels sure that, with all her manners, airs, and
so forth, she cannot be a lady, though many a lady's
companion, as she was to your mother, unhappily is.'
</p>

<p>
Roland remained silent, sucking his cheroot viciously.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' observed his uncle, 'her very notes in their
pomposity speak of self-assertion.'
</p>

<p>
'In going&mdash;unwillingly as I shall&mdash;to Earlshaugh, I don't
know how the deuce I may get on with such an incubus,'
said Roland thoughtfully; and now thoughts of the cold
welcome that awaited him by the hearth that had been his
father's, and their forefathers' for generations past, made
him naturally think and feel more warmly and kindly of
those with whom he was now, and more disposed to cling to
the loving old kinsman who eyed him so affectionately, and
the sweet, gentle cousin, every motion of whose white hands
and handsome head was full of grace; and thus, more
tenderly than ever was his wont, he looked upon her and
addressed her, softly touching her hands, as he affected to
sort, but rather disarranged, the wool in her work-basket;
and, though the days were rather past now when he regarded
with interest and admiration every pretty girl as the probable
wife of his future, and he had not thought of Hester in
that sense at all, she was not without a subtle interest for
him that he could scarcely define.
</p>

<p>
'Give me some music, Hester&mdash;by Jove!  I am getting
quite into the blues; there is a piano in the next room,'
said Roland, throwing aside his cigar and leading her away;
'a song if you will, cousin,' he added, opening the instrument
and adjusting the stool, on which she seated herself.
</p>

<p>
'What song, Roland?'
</p>

<p>
'Any&mdash;well, the old, old one of which you sang a verse
to me the other evening in the lawn.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you really wish it?' she asked, looking round at him
with half-drooped lashes, and an earnest expression in her
dark, starry eyes.
</p>

<p>
'I do, indeed, Hester&mdash;for "Auld Langsyne."'  So she
at once gave her whole skill and power to the Jacobite air
and the simple, old song which ran thus
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The visions of the buried past<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come thronging, dearer far<br />
  Than joys the present hour can give,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than present objects are.<br />
  I love to dwell among their shades,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That open to my view;<br />
  The dreams of perished men, and years,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bygone glory, too.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'For though such retrospect is sad,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a sadness sweet,<br />
  The forms of those whom we revere,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In memory to meet.<br />
  Since nothing in this changing world<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is constant but decay;<br />
  And early flowers but bloom the first,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pass the first away!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As the little song closed, the girl's voice, full as she was of
her own thoughts, became exquisitely sweet, even sad.
</p>

<p>
'Hester, thank you, dear,' said Roland, laying a hand on
her soft shoulder, with a sudden gush of unusual tenderness.
'The early flowers that bloomed so sweetly with us have not
yet passed away, surely, Hester?'
</p>

<p>
'I hope not, Roland,' she replied, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
'And I, too, hope not,' said he, stooping, and careless of
the eyes of Sir Harry, who had been drumming time to the
air on a teapoy, he pressed his lips to the straight white
division between her close and rich dark hair.
</p>

<p>
As he did so he felt her thrill beneath the touch of his
lips, and though his nonchalant air of indifference was gone
just then he said nothing more, but he thought:
</p>

<p>
'Is not this playing with fire?'

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
THE COUSINS.
</h3>

<p>
Some days passed on after the little episode at the piano,
and the intercourse between the cousins, if tender and
alluring, was still somewhat strange, undecided, and
doubtful&mdash;save in the recesses of Hester's heart.
</p>

<p>
Rambling together, as in days past, among the familiar
and beautiful sylvan scenery around Merlwood, times there
certainly were, when eye met eye with an expression that
told its own story, and each seemed to feel that their silence
covered a deeper feeling than words could express, and that
though the latter were not forthcoming as yet, their hearts
and lives might soon be filled by a great joy, on the part of
the untutored girl especially.
</p>

<p>
At others, Roland, though not quite past seven-and-twenty,
had, of course, seen too much of the world and of life, in
and out of garrison, to be a hot-headed and reckless lover,
or to rush into a position which left him no safe or
honourable line of retreat.
</p>

<p>
His passions were strong, but tempered by experience and
quite under his control; and he was inclined to be somewhat
of a casuist.
</p>

<p>
'Was this brilliant and attractive companion,' he sometimes
asked himself, 'the same little girl who had been his
playmate in the past, who had so often faded out of his
boyish existence amid other scenes and places?  And now
did she really care for him in <i>that</i> way after all?'
</p>

<p>
His manner was kind and affectionate to her, but playful,
and while lacking pointed tenderness, there was&mdash;she
thought&mdash;something forced about it at times.
</p>

<p>
When this suspicion occurred, her pride took the alarm.
Could it be that she had insensibly allowed her heart to slip
out of her own keeping into that of one from whom no
genuine word of love had come to her?  Then the fear of
this would sting Hester to the soul, and make her at
times&mdash;even after the <i>[oe]illades</i> and eloquent silences referred
to&mdash;cold and reserved; and old Sir Harry, who, for many reasons,
monetary and otherwise, apart from a sincere and fatherly
regard for his only nephew, would have been rejoiced to
have him as a son-in-law, would mutter to himself:
</p>

<p>
'Do they know their own minds, these two young fools?'
</p>

<p>
He often thought sadly and seriously of Hester's future,
for he had been an improvident man; his funds and his
pensions passed away with himself; thus it was with very
unalloyed delight that he watched the pair together again as
in the days of their childhood, and he wove many a castle
in the air; but they all assumed the form of a certain turreted
mansion in the East Neuk of Fife.  Then he would add to
Hester's annoyance by saying to her in a caressing and
blundering way:
</p>

<p>
'He will love you very dearly, as he ought to do, some
day, my pet; and if you don't love him just now, you also
will in time.  Your poor mother would have liked it&mdash;Roland
was ever her favourite.'
</p>

<p>
'Please not to say these things, papa,' implored Hester,
though they were alone, and she caressed his old white head,
for Sir Harry seldom or never spoke of her mother, whose
death occurred some twelve years before, without an emotion
which he could not conceal, for he was gentle and loving by
nature.
</p>

<p>
'Bother the fellow!' said Sir Harry testily, ashamed that
his voice had broken and his eyes grown full; 'he should
know his own heart by this time.'
</p>

<p>
'I would rather, papa, you did not say such things.'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;I can't help thinking of them, and you have no
one to confide in, Pet Hester, but me,' he added, drawing
her head down on his breast.
</p>

<p>
'If it will make you any happier, dear papa,' said Hester
in a very low voice, 'I will promise to do as you wish, if
Roland asks me to love him, which he has not done yet.
Anyway, it does not matter,' she added, a little irrelevantly;
'I care for no one else.'
</p>

<p>
'Not even for Malcolm of Dunnimarle?' he asked
laughingly.
</p>

<p>
'No, papa&mdash;not even for Malcolm Skene.'
</p>

<p>
'He admires you immensely, Hester, but then Roland
seems to me just the sort of fellow to advise and protect&mdash;to
be good to a girl&mdash;strong and brave, kind and tender.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, hush, papa,' said Hester, ready to sink with confusion
and annoyance; 'here he comes,' she added, as Roland
came lounging through an open French window into the
dining-room.
</p>

<p>
'What about Skene of Dunnimarle, uncle&mdash;surely I heard
his name?' he asked, adding to Hester's emotion of
confusion, though he failed to notice it.  'May I finish my
cigar here, Hester?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, please do&mdash;I rather like it,' she replied hastily.
</p>

<p>
'I have asked Skene for the shooting next month at
Earlshaugh&mdash;to knock over a few birds.'
</p>

<p>
'That will be pleasant for Hester; he is rather an admirer
of hers,' said Sir Harry.
</p>

<p>
'I don't know that he is,' said Hester; 'and if you talk
that way, I shall not go to Earlshaugh this summer at all,
papa.'
</p>

<p>
'After your promise to me that you will do so?' asked
Roland.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, even after my promise to you,' she replied, as she
left the room.
</p>

<p>
'I'll tell you a strange story of Malcolm's father when we
were together in Central India,' said Sir Harry, to change
the subject.  'It happened at Jhansi&mdash;you never heard it, I
suppose?'
</p>

<p>
'Not that I know of,' replied Roland, who was already
weary of the Indian reminiscences that Sir Harry contrived
to drag into conversation whenever he could.
</p>

<p>
'Well, it was a strange affair&mdash;very much out of the
common, and happened in this way.  Duncan Skene was
Captain of our Grenadiers&mdash;ah, we <i>had</i> Grenadiers then,
before the muddlers of later years came!&mdash;and a handsomer
fellow than Duncan never wore a pair of epaulettes.  A year
before we stormed Jhansi from the Pandies, we were in
quarters there, and all was as quiet at Allahabad as it is here
in the valley of the Esk.  We did not occupy the city or the
Star Fort, but we had lines outside the former then, and one
night Duncan, when pretty well primed, it was thought, after
leaving the mess bungalow, betook him towards his own,
which stood in rather a remote part of the cantonment.  All
seemed dark and quiet, and the <i>ghurries</i> at the posts had
announced the hour of two in the morning, when Duncan
came unexpectedly upon a large and well-lighted tent, within
which he saw six or seven fellows of ours&mdash;old faces that he
knew, but had not seen for some time&mdash;all carousing and
drinking round the table; he entered, and was at once made
welcome by them all.
</p>

<p>
'Now, Duncan must have been pretty well primed indeed
not to have been sobered and chilled by what he saw; he
could scarcely believe his eyes or his own identity, and
thought that for the past year he must have been in a dream;
for there he was met with outstretched hands and hearty
greetings by many of ours who he thought were gone to their
last homes.  There was Jack Atherly, second to none in the
hunting-field, whom he had seen knocked over by a matchlock
ball in a rascally hill fight; and there, too, was Charley
Thorold, once our pattern sub and pattern dancing man,
who he thought had fallen the same day at the head of the
Light Company; there, too, were Maxwell and Seton, our
best strokes at billiards, whom he had seen&mdash;or thought he
had seen&mdash;die of jungle fever in Nepaul; and Hawthorn
and Bob Stuart, for whom he had backed many a bill, and
who had been assassinated by Dacoits; but now seeming all
well and jolly, hale and hearty, though a trifle pale, after all
they had undergone.  It was a marvellous&mdash;a bewildering
meeting; but he felt no emotion either of fear or surprise&mdash;as
it is said that in dreams we seldom feel the latter, though
some of his hosts in figure did at times look a little vaporous
and indistinct.
</p>

<p>
'He was forced to sit down and drink with them, which
he did, while old regimental jokes were uttered and stories
told till the tent seemed to whirl round on its pole, the pegs
all in pursuit of each other; and then Duncan thought he
must be off, as he was detailed for guard at dawn.  But ere
he quitted them, they all made him promise that he was to
rejoin them at the same place that day twelvemonth, a long
invitation, at which he laughed heartily, but to which he
acceded, promising faithfully to do so; then he reeled away,
and remembered no more till he was found fast asleep under
the hedge of his compound by the patrol about morning gun-fire.
</p>

<p>
'Duncan's dream, or late entertainment, recurred vividly
to him in all its details; he could point to the exact spot
where the tent had stood, but not a trace of it was to be
found in any way, and no more was thought about the
matter by the few in whom he confided till that time
twelvemonth, when we found ourselves before Jhansi, with
the army sent under Lord Strathnairn to avenge the awful
slaughter and butchery there of the officers of the 12th
Native Infantry by the mutineers, from whom we took the
place by storm; and in the conflict, at the very hour of the
morning in which Duncan Skene had had that weird meeting
and given that terrible promise, and on the very spot where
the supposed tent stood, he was killed by a cannon shot; and
just about the same time I received the infernal bullet which
is lodged in me still.
</p>

<p>
'That is a story beyond the common, Roland, for Skene
of ours was a fellow above all superstition, and wild though
his dream&mdash;if a dream it was&mdash;he was wont to relate it in a
jocular way to more than one&mdash;myself among the number.'
</p>

<p>
Was it the case that the mention of young Skene as a new
admirer&mdash;perhaps more than an admirer&mdash;of Hester had
acted as a species of fillip to Roland?  It almost seemed so,
for after that there was more tenderness if possible in his
manner to her, and he did not fail to remark that he saw
music and books lying about, presented to Hester by the
gentleman in question; and her father muttered to himself
with growing satisfaction, for he loved Roland well:
</p>

<p>
'Now they are all day together, just as they used to be;
and see, he is actually carrying her watering pan for the
rosebuds.  Well, Roland, that is better fun, I suppose, than
carrying the lines of Tel-el-Kebir!'  And the old gentleman
laughed at his own conceit till he felt his Jhansi bullet cause
an aching where it lodged.  This companionship filled the
heart of the girl with supreme happiness, and more than
once she recalled the words of a writer who says of such
times: 'I think there are days when one's whole past life
seems stirred within one, and there come to the surface
unlooked-for visions and pictures, with gleams from the
depths below.  Are they of memory or of hope?  Or is it
possible that those two words mean one thing only, and are
one at last when our lives are rounded and complete?'
</p>

<p>
One evening, after being absent in the city, Roland
suddenly, when he and Hester were alone, opened a handsome
morocco case wherein reposed, in their dark-blue satin
bed, a necklace of brilliant cairngorms set in gold with a
beautiful pendant composed of a single Oriental amethyst
encircled by the purest of pearls.
</p>

<p>
'A little gift for you, Hester,' said he; 'I am soon going
to Earlshaugh, and I hope to see you wear these there,'
added he, clasping the necklace round her slender throat.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Roland!' exclaimed Hester in a breathless voice,
while her colour changed, 'can I accept such a gift?'
</p>

<p>
'From me&mdash;your cousin&mdash;Hester?' he asked softly but
reproachfully, and paused.  Beyond the gift he gave no
distinct sign as yet, and it flashed on Hester's mind that
with the jewels there was no ring.  Could that be an omission?
Scarcely.
</p>

<p>
Then, seized by a sudden impulse, he abruptly, yet softly
and caressingly, drew her towards him and kissed her more
than once.  He had often saluted her before at meeting and
parting, but always in a cousinly way; but this seemed very
different now.
</p>

<p>
Breathless, dazed apparently, the trembling girl pushed
him from her, and he gazed at her with some surprise as she
said:
</p>

<p>
'Why did you do that, Roland?  It is cruel&mdash;unkind of
you,' she added, with trembling fingers essaying, but in vain,
to unclasp the necklet.
</p>

<p>
'Cruel and unkind&mdash;between us, Hester?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' she said, blushing deeply, and then growing very
pale.
</p>

<p>
'I forgot myself for a moment, dearest Hester, in my
fondness of you.'
</p>

<p>
She was trembling very much now, and as he took her
hands caressingly within his own, her eyes grew full of tears.
</p>

<p>
'Hester, you know&mdash;you know well,' he began, with a
voice that indicated deep emotion.
</p>

<p>
'Know what, Roland?' said she, trying to withdraw her
hands.
</p>

<p>
'That I love you,' he was about to say, and would no
doubt have said, but that Sir Harry most inopportunely came
limping heavily in, so Roland was compelled to pause.  The
few words that might have changed all the story we have to
tell were left unuttered, and next moment Hester was gone.
</p>

<p>
'He does love me!' she thought in the solitude of her
own room; 'love me as I love him, and wish to be loved!'
</p>

<p>
Long she pondered over the episode and gazed on his
gift ere she retired to rest that night.  She hoped in time to
bind him to her more closely, for she thought he was a man
who would love once in a lifetime with all the strength of a
great and noble nature.
</p>

<p>
Sweetly and brightly the girl smiled at her own reflection
in the mirror as with deft fingers she coiled up her rich
brown hair for the night; while slowly but surely she felt
herself, with a new and joyous thrill, to be turning her back
upon the past, yet a happy and an innocent past it had been,
and that she was standing on the threshold of a new and
brighter world of dreams.
</p>

<p>
At last she slept.
</p>

<p>
Roland Lindsay had been on the point of declaring his
love, but something&mdash;was it Fatality?&mdash;withheld him; then
the interruption came, and the golden moment passed!
</p>

<p>
Would it ever come again?
</p>

<p>
But a change was at hand, which neither he nor Hester
could foresee.

CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
ANNOT DRUMMOND.
</h3>

<p>
Next morning when Hester, in the most becoming of
matutinal costumes, pale rose colour, which so suited her
dark hair and complexion, was presiding over the breakfast
table, and Sir Harry was about to dip into his newspapers,
selecting a letter from a few that lay beside her plate, she
said:
</p>

<p>
'Papa, I have a little surprise for you&mdash;a letter from
Annot Drummond, my cousin; she comes here to-night <i>en
route</i> to Earlshaugh, invited by Maud, your sister,' she added
to Roland; 'by this time she will be leaving London at
Euston.'
</p>

<p>
'"London, that maelstrom of mud and mannikins," as it
has perhaps been unjustly stigmatized by George Gilfillan,'
said Sir Harry, laughing, 'and she is to be here
to-night&mdash;that is sudden.'
</p>

<p>
'But Annot was always a creature of impulse, papa!'
</p>

<p>
'So some think,' said her father; 'but to me her impulses
always seemed to come by fits and starts.  However, I shall
be delighted to see the dear child.'
</p>

<p>
'The "dear child" is now nearly eighteen, papa.'
</p>

<p>
'Heavens&mdash;how time runs on!&mdash;eighteen&mdash;yes.'
</p>

<p>
'And she and I are to go to Earlshaugh together in
October&mdash;that is if you can spare me, papa,' added Hester,
colouring, and keeping the silver urn between herself and
Roland.
</p>

<p>
'Excellent; I shall make up a little party for the covert
shooting, to entertain Skene of Dunnimarle, Jack Elliot of
ours, and one or two more, if I can,' said the latter.  'I
have been so long away from Earlshaugh; but doubtless
dear little Maud and the&mdash;the stepmother&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Sir Harry's brow clouded at the name, and Roland paused.
</p>

<p>
'You did not see Annot when in London?' said Hester.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;I had no time&mdash;she lived in a part of South
Belgravia, rather out of my wanderings,' replied Roland.
</p>

<p>
'She is a very attractive girl, gentlemen think.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah,' was the brief response of Roland, intent more on
his breakfast than the attractions of Annot Drummond, who
was the only child of Sir Harry's favourite sister, a widow,
whose slender circumstances compelled her to reside in a
small and dull old-fashioned house of the last century in
that locality which lies on the borderland of fashionable
London, where the narrow windows, the doorways with huge
knockers, quaint half-circular fanlights, and link extinguishers
in the railings, tell of the days when George III. was
King.
</p>

<p>
'She complains, Roland, that you did not call on her, in
passing through London.  Poor Annot,' said Hester.
</p>

<p>
'Our, or rather your, little Cockney cousin, who no doubt
loves her love with an A, because he is 'andsome,' laughed
Roland.
</p>

<p>
'How can you mock Annot?' said Hester; 'she is a very
accomplished girl&mdash;and lovely too&mdash;at least all men say so.'
</p>

<p>
'And you, cousin Hester?'
</p>

<p>
'I quite agree with them.'  Hester was a sincere admirer
of beauty, and&mdash;perhaps owing to her own great attractions&mdash;was
alike noble and frank in admitting those of others.
'Her photo is in the album on that side table.'
</p>

<p>
Roland was not interested enough in the matter even to
examine it.
</p>

<p>
'You will be sure to admire her,' added Hester with an
arch and even loving smile as she thought of last night and
the jewel that had been clasped about her neck.
</p>

<p>
'Admire her&mdash;perhaps; but nothing more, I am sure,'
replied Roland, while Hester's colour deepened, and her
smile brightened, though her long lashes drooped.  He gave
her covertly one of his fond glances, which to the girl's loving
eyes seemed to spread a glory over his dark face, and a
close hand-clasp followed, unseen by Sir Harry, who was
already absorbed in the news from Egypt; but coyly and
shyly&mdash;she could scarcely have told why&mdash;all that day she
gave him no opportunity of recurring to the episode of the
preceding evening, or resuming the thread of that sweet story
which her father had so unwittingly interrupted.
</p>

<p>
Since that minute of time, and its intended and most
probable <i>finale</i>, what had been Roland Lindsay's secret
thoughts?  They were many; but through all and above
all had been a home such as he could make even of gloomy
and embattled Earlshaugh, if brightened by Hester's
sweet face, her alluring eyes and smile; with its echoes
wakened by her happy ringing voice, free from every note of
care as those of the merles in the wood around her father's
house.
</p>

<p>
But withal came emotions of doubt and anger, as he
thought of his father's will, his own supposed false position
thereby, and how the future would develop itself.
</p>

<p>
Though old, and being so, he might be disposed to take
gloomy views of these doubts, that cheery veteran Sir Harry
saw little or nothing of them, and had but one thought while
he limped along the river's bank, enjoying his cheroot under
the shady and overarching trees that cast their shadows on
the brawling Esk, that his nephew Roland was the one man
in all the world with whom he could fearlessly trust the
happiness of his daughter; and lovingly and fondly, with most
pardonable selfishness, the old man pondered over this; and
thus it was that the hopeful thoughts referred to in the
preceding chapter were ever recurring to him and wreathing his
wrinkled face with smiles, especially after he had seen the
beautiful necklet, which Hester had duly shown him, clasped
round her snowy throat.  He loved to see them together,
and to hear them singing together at the piano or in the
garden, as if their hearts were like those of the merle and
mavis, so blithe, content, and happy they seemed, as when
they were boy and girl in the pleasant past time, when she
wore short frocks and little aprons, the pockets of which
were always full of Roland's boyish presents&mdash;sometimes the
plunder of neighbours' fruit trees.  While to Roland the
revived memory or vision of a bright little girl with a tangled
mass of curls, who was often petulant, and then would
confess her tiny faults as she sobbed on his shoulder, till
absolved by a kiss, was ever before him; and now they
could linger, while 'dropping at times into that utterly
restful silence which only those can enjoy who understand
each other well; and perhaps, indeed, only those who love
each other dearly.'
</p>

<p>
But this day was an active one with Hester.  She chose
rooms for her coming cousin, relinquishing for a time those
slippers of dark blue embroidery on buff leather with which
she was busy for Roland.  Vases of fresh flowers, selected
and sorted with loving hands, were placed in all available
points to decorate the sleeping and dressing rooms of Annot
Drummond; draped back, the laced curtains of the windows
displayed the lovely valley of the Esk, up which the river,
as it flowed eastward, softly murmured; Kevock-bank and
the wooded Kirkbrae on the north; the slope of Polton on
the south; Lasswade, with its quaint bridge, in the middle
distance, and Eldin woods beyond&mdash;a sweet and sylvan view
on which Hester was never weary of gazing.
</p>

<p>
Thus with her passed most of the day; how it was spent
she scarcely knew; then evening came, and she and Sir
Harry drove into town to meet their expected visitor; and
Roland never knew how much he missed her till he was left
to his own thoughts&mdash;to the inevitable cheroot, and after
despatching his letters to Malcolm Skene, to Jack Elliot
'of ours,' and others, to vary his time between lounging in
the hammock between the shady trees and tossing pebbles
into the Esk.
</p>

<p>
At last, after the shadows had deepened in the glen and
dusk had completely closed in, the sound of carriage wheels,
with the opening and banging to of doors, announced the
arrival of Annot Drummond, accompanied by her uncle and
cousin; and Roland assisted them to alight.  For a moment
the tightly gloved and childlike hand of Miss Drummond
rested in his, and her eyes, the precise colour of which he
could not determine, but which seemed light and sparkling,
met his own with an expression of confidence and inquiry.
He had simply a vague idea of sunny eyes and waving golden
hair.  The rest was undiscoverable.
</p>

<p>
'Roland, I suppose,' she exclaimed, laughing, adding, 'I
beg your pardon, Captain Lindsay&mdash;but I have heard so
much of you from dearest Hester.'
</p>

<p>
'Roland he is, my dear girl, and now welcome to
Merlwood&mdash;welcome for your mother's sake and your own!'
exclaimed Sir Harry, as he turned to give some orders about
the luggage, and Annot, accompanied by Hester, who
towered above her by a head, tripped indoors, with a nod
and a smile to the old housekeeper and other servants, all of
whom she knew.  She seemed, indeed, a bright, fairy and
airy-like little creature, in the most becoming of travelling
costumes and most piquant of hats.
</p>

<p>
'She seems quite a child yet, by Jove!' said Sir Harry,
looking after the <i>petite</i> creature, as she hurried to her room
to change her dress, and imbibe the inevitable cup of tea
brought by the motherly old housekeeper.
</p>

<p>
'What do you think of our Annot?' asked Hester,
returning for a moment.
</p>

<p>
'That she has a wonderfully fair skin,' replied Roland slowly.
</p>

<p>
'All the Drummond women have that&mdash;it runs in the
clan.  But her eyes&mdash;are they not beautiful?'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot say.'
</p>

<p>
'Did you not see them?'
</p>

<p>
'No, Hester.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'She scarcely looked at me.'
</p>

<p>
'They are the loveliest hazel!' exclaimed Hester.
</p>

<p>
'Hazel&mdash;rather green, I think; but you know, I prefer
eyes of violet blue or gray to all others, Hester.'
</p>

<p>
She laughed, as she knew her own were the eyes referred
to; but now the gong&mdash;a trophy of Sir Harry's from
Jhansi&mdash;sounded, and Annot came hurrying downstairs, and clasped
one of Hester's arms within her own so caressingly, with her
white fingers interlaced.
</p>

<p>
To Roland now, at second sight, she looked wonderfully
<i>petite</i> and gentle, pure and fair&mdash;'fair as a snow-flake and
nearly just as fragile,' Sir Harry once said, and she clung
lovingly and confidingly to Hester, but it seemed as if, of
necessity, Annot must always be clinging to someone or
something.

CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
'IS SHE NOT PASSING FAIR?'
</h3>

<p>
When she took her seat at table to partake of a meal
which was something between a late dinner and an early
supper, Roland saw how exquisitely fair Annot Drummond
was, as with a pretty air of childishness she clung to Hester&mdash;an
air that became her <i>petite</i> figure and <i>mignonne</i> face, but
not her years, as she was some months older than her cousin,
who with her dark hair and eyes he thought looked almost
brown beside this flaxen fairy, that seemed to realize the
comment of old Cambden, who says&mdash;'The women of the
family of Drummond, for charming beauty and complexion,
are beyond all others, and in so much that they have been
most delighted in by kings.'
</p>

<p>
She had, however, greenish hazel eyes&mdash;greenish they
were decidedly, yet lovely and sparkling, shaded by brown
lashes and eyebrows, with golden hair, wonderful in quantity
and tint, that rippled and shone.  Her complexion was pure
and pale, while her pouting lips seemed absolute scarlet,
rather than coral; and her eyes spoke as freely as her
tongue, lighting and brightening with her subject, whatever
it was.
</p>

<p>
Annot's was indeed a tiny face; at times a laughing, a
loving and petulant face, and puzzling in so far that one
knew not when it was prettiest, or what expression became
it most; yet Hester&mdash;a very close observer&mdash;thought there
was something cunning and watchful in it at times now.
</p>

<p>
Seeing that Roland was closely observing the new arrival,
she said:
</p>

<p>
'Would you ever imagine, cousin Roland, that Annot
and I are just about an age? she looks like fifteen, and I
was eighteen my last birthday.'
</p>

<p>
'Eighteen,' thought Roland Lindsay, toying with a few
grapes; 'can it be?&mdash;that golden-haired dolly&mdash;old enough
to be the heroine of a novel or a tragedy&mdash;old enough to be
a wife and the mistress of a household?  By Jove, it seems
incredible.'
</p>

<p>
And as she prattled away of London, the Park and the
Row, what plays were 'on' at the different theatres, of new
dresses, sights and scenes, and so forth; of her journey
down, a long and weary one of some hundred miles, and
the attention she received from various gentlemen passengers,
the bright chatterer, all smiles, animation, and full of little
tricks of manner, seemed indeed a contrast to the taller,
graver, dark-haired, and dark-eyed Hester, whose violet-blue
eye looked quite black by gaslight.
</p>

<p>
Though a niece of Sir Harry's, Annot Drummond was no
cousin to Roland Lindsay, yet she seemed quite inclined,
erelong, to adopt the <i>rôle</i> of being one; for he was quite
handsome enough and interesting enough in aspect and
bearing to attract a girl like her, who instinctively filled up
her time with every chance-medley man she met, and knew
fully how to appreciate one whose prospects and positions
were so undoubtedly good; thus she repeatedly turned with
her irresistible smiles and <i>espièglerie</i> to him, as if he were
her sole, or certainly her chief, audience.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile old Sir Henry sat silently smoking his
inevitable hookah, eyeing her with loving looks, and tracing&mdash;or
rather trying to trace&mdash;a likeness between her and his
favourite sister; and Hester, who had of course seen her
cousin often before, sat somewhat silent, for then each girl
was, perhaps unconsciously, trying to know, to learn, and to
grasp the nature of the other.
</p>

<p>
'Hester,' said Annot in a well-managed aside, 'I saw your
friend Skene of Dunnimarle in London, and he talked of
you to me, and of no one but you, which I thought scarcely
fair.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'One girl doesn't care to hear another's praises only for
an hour without end, I suppose.'
</p>

<p>
Hester looked annoyed, but Roland seemed to hear the
remark as if he heard it not, which was not the case, as
Hester's name had been more than once mentioned in
conjunction with that of the young fellow in question.
</p>

<p>
'I remember when Skene of ours at Sealkote&mdash;&mdash;' Sir
Harry was beginning, when Hester contrived to cut the
Indian reminiscence short.
</p>

<p>
Next morning Annot was in the garden betimes, natheless
the fatigue of her long railway journey; she seemed bright
as a summer butterfly, inhaling the fresh odour of the
flowers, under the shady trees, amid the rhododendrons of
every brilliant tint, the roses and sub-tropical plants that
opened their rich petals to the August sunshine, and more
than all did she seem to enjoy the fresh, soft breeze that
came up the steep winding glen or ravine through which the
Esk ran gurgling; and ever and anon she glanced at her
companion Roland, indulging in that playful <i>gaîté de coeur</i>,
which so often ends in disaster, for she was a finished flirt to
the tips of her dainty fingers; and he was thinking, between
the whiffs of his permitted cigar: What caused his present
emotion&mdash;this sudden attraction towards a girl whom he
had never seen before, and whose existence had been barely
known to him?  And now she was culling a dainty 'button-hole'
for him, and making him select a bouquet for the
breast of her morning dress, a most becoming robe of light
blue cashmere with ribbons and lace of white.
</p>

<p>
Could it be that mysterious influence of which he had
heard often, and yet of which he knew so little&mdash;a current of
affinity so subtle and penetrating, that none under its spell
could resist it?  He was not casuist enough to determine;
but looked about for his cousin Hester and muttered:
</p>

<p>
'Don't play the fool, Roland, my boy!'
</p>

<p>
Usually very diffident and reticent in talking about himself
and his affairs, even the gentle and winning Hester had
failed, as she said, to 'draw him out;' but now, Annot&mdash;the
irrepressible Annot&mdash;led him on to do so by manifesting, or
affecting to manifest, a keen interest in them, and thus lured
him into flattering confidences to her alone about his
garrison life in England and the Mediterranean, or as much
as he cared to tell of it; his campaigns in Egypt; his escape
from the slaughter of Kashgate; his risks and wounds; his
medals and clasps; his regiment, comrades, and so forth, in
all of which she seemed suddenly to develop the deepest
interest, though perhaps an evil-minded person might have
hinted that she had a deeper and truer interest in Earlshaugh
and its surroundings, of which he had no conception as yet.
</p>

<p>
Hester quickly saw through these little manoeuvres, and
at first she laughed at them, thinking they were all the girl's
way; that Roland was the only young man at Merlwood;
and so, by habit and nature, she must talk to him, laugh
with him, make <i>[oe]illades</i> and dress for him; and in dressing
she was an adept, choosing always soft and clinging materials
of colours suited to her pure complexion and fair beauty, and
well she knew by experience already that 'love feeds on
suggestions&mdash;almost illusions,' as a French writer says; 'for
the greatest charm about a woman's dress is less what it
displays than what it only hints at;' and Annot had all that
skill or taste in costume which is a great speciality of London
girls.
</p>

<p>
During the whole day after this arrival, and even the
following one, Hester was unpleasantly conscious that
because Annot Drummond absorbed Roland so entirely, he
had scarcely an opportunity of addressing herself alone, and
still less of referring&mdash;beyond a glance and a hand pressure
or so forth&mdash;to that evening, on the last minutes of which
so much had seemed to hinge.
</p>

<p>
A little music usually closed each evening, and Annot
performed, from Chopin and others, various 'fireworks' on
the piano, as Roland was wont to term them; while at
Hester's little songs, such as that one to the air of the
'Briar Bush,' she openly laughed, declaring they were quite
'too, too!'
</p>

<p>
Her voice was not so trained as Annot's, and was not
remarkable for strength or compass, but it was clear and
sweet, fresh and true, and she sang with unaffected
expression, being well desirous of pleasing her cousin
Roland&mdash;her lover as she perhaps deemed him now.
</p>

<p>
Annot's song, after Hester had given a little <i>chanson</i> from
Beranger&mdash;'<i>Du, du liegst mir im Herzen</i>,' accompanied&mdash;though
sung indifferently&mdash;with several <i>[oe]illades</i> at Roland,
gave her an opportunity to make, what Hester termed, some
of her 'wild speeches.'
</p>

<p>
'A sweet love song, Annot,' said the latter.
</p>

<p>
'A love song it is&mdash;but twaddle, you know,' replied Annot,
turning quickly the leaves of her music.
</p>

<p>
'Twaddle&mdash;how?'
</p>

<p>
'About marrying for love only and not money, Hester.
That is an old-fashioned prejudice which is fast dying out,
mamma tells me.  Thank Heaven I am poor!' she added,
with a pretty shrug of her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'Why?' asked Hester.
</p>

<p>
'Because, when poor, one knows one is loved for self
alone.'
</p>

<p>
The reply was made in a soft voice to Hester, yet her
upward glance was shot at Roland Lindsay, and she began
a piece of music that was certainly somewhat confused,
while he&mdash;sorely puzzled&mdash;was kept on duty turning over
the leaves.
</p>

<p>
'Annot, I thought you were a finished performer!' said
Hester with some surprise and pique.
</p>

<p>
'I was taught like other girls at Madame Raffineur's
finishing school in Belgium; and I <i>can</i> get through a piece,
as it is called, without many stoppages, though I often
forget upon what key I am playing, and use the pedals too at
haphazard, yet they are beyond my skill; but I find that
whatever I play&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Even a noise?' suggested Hester.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, even a noise, while it lasts, puts down all conversation,
and when it is over everyone graciously says, "Thanks&mdash;so
much!"  "Do I sing?" is next asked, but I mean to
practise so sedulously when I return to London.'
</p>

<p>
'A bright little twaddler!' thought Hester, with a slight
curl of her handsome upper lip.
</p>

<p>
'You talked of the Row&mdash;you ride, I suppose?' said
Roland to change the subject.
</p>

<p>
'I have no horse,' replied Annot.
</p>

<p>
'No horse!  At Earlshaugh I shall get you an excellent
mount.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, thanks so much, cousin Roland!' replied Annot,
and while running her slender fingers rapidly to and fro
upon the keys she gave him one of her glances which were
never given without 'point.'
</p>

<p>
'You seem pleased with her, Roland?' said Hester as
they drew a little way apart.
</p>

<p>
'Well, I think she is wonderfully fair.'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing more?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, fair enough, and all such little golden-haired women
since the days of Lucrezia Borgia, I suppose, make no end
of mischief.'
</p>

<p>
'Roland!' said Hester, her eyes dilating.
</p>

<p>
Her cousin laughed, but knew not, perhaps, how truly and
prophetically he spoke.
</p>

<p>
'Did you like my song?' asked Hester, after a little pause.
</p>

<p>
'What song?'
</p>

<p>
'Can you ask me?  The little <i>chanson</i> of Béranger, that
you admire so much.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, yes&mdash;pardon me.'
</p>

<p>
'You were thinking of her when you should have been
listening to <i>me</i>,' said Hester with an unmistakable flash in
her dark eyes, and he felt the rebuke.
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;I was thinking, perhaps&mdash;but not as you suppose,
or say, Hester,' replied Roland, with a little laugh; but a
time came when Annot Drummond and her presence proved
to be no laughing matter.
</p>

<p>
Days passed on now; whether it was that Annot was
perpetually in the way, or that no proper opportunity
occurred&mdash;which in the circle of a country house seemed
barely probable&mdash;Roland did not seek for the 'lost chord,'
or seem prepared to resume the thread of the sweet old
story that had been dropped so abruptly, and poor Hester
felt in her secret heart perplexed and piqued on a most
tender point, and would have been more than human had
she been otherwise.
</p>

<p>
On an afternoon the quartette were seated under a spreading
beech, the girls idling over their tea, Roland and his
uncle smoking, when Annot suddenly proposed a walk to
the ruins of Roslin Castle, through the woods.  Roland at
once rose and offered himself as escort; but Hester, who
had already begun to feel herself a little <i>de trop</i>&mdash;a bitter
and mortifying conviction&mdash;professed to have something to
attend to, and quietly declined the stroll, on which, with
something of an aching heart, she saw the two set forth
together.
</p>

<p>
Archæology was not much in the way of Miss Annot
Drummond, she knew; but she also knew that if any ice
remained between these two (which was very improbable)
it would be surely thawed before that stroll ended, while in
assisting her over stiles and through hedges Roland's hand
touched that of Annot, or when her skirt brushed him, as
they wandered through freshly mown meadows and under
shady trees, by the steep, narrow, and rocky paths that lead
to the shattered stronghold of the Sinclairs&mdash;the glances and
touches and hand-clasps, enforced by the surmounting of
slippery banks and apparently perilous ditches, where the
beautiful ferns grow thick and green; and then the rambling
among the ruins that crown the lofty rock and overlook such
lovely and seductive scenery.
</p>

<p>
Of what might have passed Hester could only, yet readily,
guess; her heart was full of aching thoughts&mdash;full well-nigh
to bursting at times&mdash;when the pair returned, silent
apparently, very happy too, and inclined to converse more
with their eyes than their lips; and singular to say, that of
the sylvan scenery of that wonderful glen, and of the ruined
abode of the whilom Dukes of Oldenburg and Princes of
Orkney, Annot Drummond seemed to have seen or noted&mdash;nothing;
and a sense of this, with what it implied, added
to the secret mortification of Hester.
</p>

<p>
Thus, despite herself, that evening at dinner the latter
failed to act a part, and scarcely spoke, but seemed to play
with her knife and fork rather than eat; and fortunately no
one observed her, save perhaps her father.  She was
painfully listless, yet nervously observant.
</p>

<p>
Had Roland Lindsay's thoughts not been elsewhere he
must have seen how already the change in her looks was
intensified by the brilliance, the sparkling eyes, and the soft,
gay laughter of Annot, and how, when she did speak, she
nervously twisted her rings round and round her slender
fingers, seeming restless and <i>distraite</i>.
</p>

<p>
A charming girl was certainly no novelty to Roland; nor
did he now regard one&mdash;as in his boyhood&mdash;as a strange
and mystic being to worship.  He knew girls pretty well,
he thought, also their ways and pretty tricks, their fascinations
and little artifices; yet those of Annot&mdash;and she was
a mass of them&mdash;assuredly did bewilder him and attract his
fancy, though he only admitted to Hester that she was as
'fashionably appointed and well-got-up a girl as could be
found within a three-mile radius of Park Lane.'
</p>

<p>
She was indeed full of sweet and winning&mdash;if cultivated&mdash;ways.
The inflexions of her voice were very sympathetic,
and the ever-varying expression of her bright hazel eyes&mdash;albeit
they were 'dashed' with green&mdash;added to her fascination
and influence; whilst she had a childish and pleading
way of putting her lovely white hands together when she
asked for anything that&mdash;as old Sir Henry said&mdash;'would
melt the heart of a cannon-ball.'
</p>

<p>
Then, with regard to Roland, she was always asking his
advice about some petty trifle or book (though she was not
a reader), and deferred to his opinion so sweetly that she
gave him a higher idea of his own intellect than he had ever
possessed before; for she had all the subtle finesse of flattery
and flirtation, without seeming to possess or exert either;
and thus poor Hester was&mdash;to use a sporting phrase&mdash;'quite
out of the running.'
</p>

<p>
One night the latter had a new insight into her cousin's
character, though Annot now never spoke, nor could be got
to speak, if possible, of Roland Lindsay.
</p>

<p>
Prior to retiring to her bed, Annot had let down and was
coiling up her wonderful wealth of golden hair, which
reached almost to her knees; and she and Hester Maule,
with whom she was still on perfectly amicable and
apparently loving terms, were exchanging their gossiping
confidences, as young girls often do at such a time; and
on this occasion Hester thought&mdash;for a space&mdash;she might
be wrong in supposing that Annot had any serious views
upon Roland Lindsay, as she saw her drop, and then hastily
snatch up, a photograph on which she had been gazing with
a smile.
</p>

<p>
'Who is this, Annot?' asked Hester.
</p>

<p>
'Only old Bob.'
</p>

<p>
'Who?'
</p>

<p>
'Bob Hoyle,' replied Annot, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'Old; why, he seems quite a boy, In uniform, too.'
</p>

<p>
'He is not a boy, though I call him "old."'
</p>

<p>
'His age?'
</p>

<p>
'Is four-and-twenty; but I have known him so long, you
know, Hester.'
</p>

<p>
'Since when?'
</p>

<p>
'Since he used to come and see his sister at Madame
Raffineur's school in Belgium.  He is awfully in love with
me.'
</p>

<p>
'Is?' queried Hester, a little relieved of her suspicions.
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;was&mdash;when younger.'
</p>

<p>
'And now?'
</p>

<p>
'He loves me still, I have no doubt.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you mean to marry him?'
</p>

<p>
'He has never asked me.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, if he did&mdash;or does ask you?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't know about that,' said Annot, as with deft little
fingers she finished and pinned her golden coil.
</p>

<p>
'Why so?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, cousin Hester, how inquisitive you are!  I like him
immensely.  He says openly that he can't stand the London
girls; that they are all very well to flirt with, dance, drive,
and talk with; but he wants a wife who in her own sweet
person will combine all the charms of fashionable and
domestic life, like me.  But then he is so poor; has little
more than his pay.  I can't fancy being poorer than I
am&mdash;love in a cottage is all bosh, you know; but I have
promised him&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What?'
</p>

<p>
'To think about it; but I won't be bound by promises,
Hester.  When I marry I want to be rich.  I must have a
carriage, beautiful horses, diamonds and dresses, for I have
no <i>dot</i> of my own.  Marry for love, indeed!  No, no, Bob,
dear.  Who in these days does anything so absurd as that?
It is as much out of fashion as chivalry, duels, and periwigs.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Annot&mdash;so young and so mercenary!' exclaimed
Hester.
</p>

<p>
'Not mercenary, only practical, cousin.  Another dear
fellow did so love me last winter, Hester!' said the girl, with
a dreamy smile.
</p>

<p>
'And now?'
</p>

<p>
'We are less than nothing to each other, Hester&mdash;after
all&mdash;after all.'
</p>

<p>
'How&mdash;why?'
</p>

<p>
'He was a second son&mdash;Mamma's <i>bête noire</i>; besides, a
married lady took him off my hands.'
</p>

<p>
'A married lady?' exclaimed Hester.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;oh, my simple cousin!  The mischief done in
London nowadays by married flirts would amaze you,
Hester; but good-night, I am so sleepy, dear.'
</p>

<p>
And kissing the latter with great <i>empressement</i> on each
cheek, Annot departed to repose with one of her silvery
laughs, leaving the impression that if 'she was passing fair'
she was also passing heartless.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
'IT WAS NO DREAM.'
</h3>

<p>
To Roland Lindsay there was some new and undefinable
attraction towards Annot Drummond, against which, to do
him justice, he strove in vain, and his eyes actually fell under
the calm glance of his cousin Hester.  'Call it what one
may,' says a writer, 'that such a power does exist, and most
seriously influences our lives, is an undoubted fact.  We may
deride and deny it as we will; but who can honestly doubt
that the sudden and mutual attraction felt by two persons
who are in essential matters absolutely ignorant of each
other, does occur in the lives of most of us, and it is not to
be fought against or laughed away in any manner.'
</p>

<p>
Whether the attraction was quite <i>mutual</i> in this instance
remains to be seen.  As yet the intercourse between Roland
and Miss Drummond <i>seemed</i>, with a little more <i>empressement</i>
of manner, merely the well-bred companionship of two
persons connected through mutual relations and residence in
the same pleasant country house; but the change in Roland's
manner to herself&mdash;veil it as he might&mdash;was subtly felt by
Hester, and became apparent even to her father, the
otherwise obtuse old Indian campaigner.
</p>

<p>
'He was ever attentive, full of fun, lightness, and merriment;
but, oh, there is no mistaking that there is a change
now&mdash;a change since <i>she</i> came.  What can it be&mdash;what has
come over him?' thought Hester.
</p>

<p>
'It is all very odd,' growled Sir Harry; 'I can't make out
the situation now.  Roland does not seem a flirting fellow,
whatever the girl may be, and she is plain when compared
with my Hester; yet he looks like a shorn Samson in the
fairy hands of this little golden-haired Delilah, and seems
never happy except when with her.  It appears to me that
people nowadays always fall in love when, where, and with
whom they ought not.  Ah, he is one of the "Lightsome
Lindsays;" yet I never saw anyone so changed,' added Sir
Harry, who had latterly found him wax weary of his Indian
reminiscences.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Annot, who firmly believed in the dictum of
Thackeray, 'that any woman who has not positively a hump
can marry any man she pleases,' quietly pursued her own
course; and day by day it was Hester's lot to see this
courtship evidently in progress&mdash;herself at times ignored and
reduced to 'playing gooseberry,' as Annot thought (if, indeed,
she ever thought at all)&mdash;reduced again to her own inner life
once more; and knowing that nothing of it could interest
them now, so much did they seem bound in each other, she
pursued her old avocations among the poor and parish
people more than ever.
</p>

<p>
The love&mdash;the budding love&mdash;he certainly once loved
<i>her</i>&mdash;was less than a shadow now!
</p>

<p>
She ceased to accompany them in their walks and long
rambles in the woody glen by Mavisbank and Eldin groves,
and knowing the time when Roland was certainly 'due' at
Earlshaugh, she counted every hour till he should leave
Merlwood.
</p>

<p>
'What a couple of wanderers you have become!' said Sir
Harry, a little pointedly.
</p>

<p>
'Roland is so sympathetic,' simpered Annot; 'he appreciates
fully all my yearnings after the beautiful, of which we
can see nothing in the brick wilderness of London; and
certainly your scenery on the Esk is surpassingly lovely,
uncle!' though in reality she cared not a jot about it, and
had somewhat the Cockney's idea of a landscape, 'that too
much wood and too much water always spoiled it.'
</p>

<p>
One evening matters had evidently reached a culminating
point with this pair.
</p>

<p>
Returning at a somewhat late hour for her, when the
gloaming was deepening into darkness, from visiting a poor
widow, to whom she had taken some comforts, Hester, on
reaching Merlwood, paused in a garden path to look around
her, pleased and soothed by the calmness and stillness of
the dewy August evening, when not a sound was heard but
the ceaseless murmur of the unseen Esk far down below.
Suddenly, amid the shrubbery, she heard familiar voices, to
which she listened dreamily, mechanically, at first; then,
startled by their tenor, she was compelled to shrink between
the great shrubs, and&mdash;however obnoxious and repugnant to
her&mdash;was compelled to overhear; and till indignation came,
as she listened, there was a passionate, pleading expression
in Hester's eyes, which was unseen in the dark; as was the
quivering of the lip that came from the torture of the soul.
</p>

<p>
Roland was speaking in accents low and eager, and
in others that were broken and tremulous Annot was
responding.
</p>

<p>
'You have made me so happy, dearest Roland, by the
first whisper that you&mdash;you loved me,' sighed the girl.
</p>

<p>
'I seem scarcely to recollect what happened to me before
I met you here, Annot,' said he.
</p>

<p>
'How so?' she asked coyly.
</p>

<p>
'It seems as if I had only existed then.'
</p>

<p>
'And now, Roland?'
</p>

<p>
'I live, my darling! for
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "In many mental forms I vainly sought<br />
  The shadow of the idol of my thought,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
till now.  In three days more&mdash;only three&mdash;my little
Annot&mdash;my golden-haired darling, I shall have to leave you for
Earlshaugh; and, till you join me there, what will life be
without you?'
</p>

<p>
He drew her close to him, and poor Hester shivered; but
flight was impossible.
</p>

<p>
'And what will life at Merlwood be to me?' replied, or
rather asked, Annot, in that caressing and cooing tone which
she well knew was one of her chief attractions.
</p>

<p>
'But Earlshaugh in time will be your home, Annot&mdash;yours,
to make what alterations you choose on the quaint
old place.  You shall reign there&mdash;the fairest and dearest
bride that ever came within its walls.'
</p>

<p>
'Do not talk thus, Roland!'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'It makes me feel as if I were selling myself.'
</p>

<p>
'Annot!' he expostulated; and she answered with that
low, cooing laugh of hers which was such a wonderful
performance.
</p>

<p>
'Now, tell me,' said she; 'were you ever in love
before?'
</p>

<p>
'Why that question, Annot?'
</p>

<p>
'I have no motive&mdash;only curiosity, Roland&mdash;yet I could
not bear to think that you had ever loved anyone else as
you do me.'
</p>

<p>
'I never did!  All men have, or have had fancies,' said
he evasively.
</p>

<p>
'I don't mean a fancy&mdash;a real love!'
</p>

<p>
'Annot?'
</p>

<p>
'Did you ever ask a girl to marry you?'
</p>

<p>
'Never&mdash;never!  My darling&mdash;my pet&mdash;my little fairy&mdash;you
alone have crept into my heart and made it all your
own!  With all their real length, how short have seemed
the August days since you came hither, Annot!&mdash;how brief
and swift the hours we spend together!  But&mdash;but&mdash;you
must say nothing of all this, our hopes and our future, to
Hester.'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;oh no; I love you too fondly to have a confidant
in the world.'
</p>

<p>
'I must seal your lips, dearest Annot,' interrupted Roland.
Then came a pause and many caresses and many endearing
names, as they slipped softly away towards the lighted
windows of the villa, and left the agonized and startled
listener free&mdash;for startled she was, and, curiously enough, for
all she had seen and suspected, she was scarcely prepared
for such a scene as this; and every caress she saw had
seemed to sink like a hot poniard into her heart, as she
stole away to her room, and strove to think, as one
might in a dream.
</p>

<p>
Vague and numb was the first impression the episode
made upon her, till feverish jealousy and mortification made
her clasp and wring her hot, dry hands, and gnaw her nether
lip, while burning tears rolled down her cheeks, with the
assurance that all was over now!
</p>

<p>
'After all&mdash;he meant nothing&mdash;nothing after all!' she
muttered; 'why did you make me love you so, Roland!'
</p>

<p>
The man she had loved&mdash;who fully, as far as manner and
almost words went, had answered her love for him, had
meant nothing, but <i>pour passer le temps</i>.  He had been, he
thought perhaps, only kind, friendly, cousinly, while
she&mdash;great Heavens!&mdash;had been on the point of laying her
affectionate heart at his feet.
</p>

<p>
Oh, what humiliation was hers!
</p>

<p>
In explanation of the lateness of their return, they had
been a long walk, the loiterers said, away below Roslin
Chapel; but said nothing of what the walk had somewhat
suddenly evolved.
</p>

<p>
When the gloaming was considerably advanced, and,
though a ruddy sunset lingered in the north-west, there was
no moon in the sky, where the evening star shone brilliantly,
they had wandered down the river-side&mdash;its current flowing
like molten silver when seen between and under the dark,
overshadowing, and weird-like trees&mdash;to where, on the
summit of its high and grassy knoll, the beautiful chapel of
Roslin towered up between them and the sky-line&mdash;the
solemn scene, as Scott has preserved it, of one of the most
thrilling and poetical of all family presages of death and
war; a legend deduced from the tomb-fires of the Norsemen,
and, doubtless, transplanted from our stormy Northern Isles
to the sylvan valley of the Esk by that old Prince of Orkney,
whose bride, Rosabelle, perished, and when the chapel
seemed filled with flame.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'O'er Roslin all that dreary night,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wondrous blaze was seen to gleam!<br />
  'Twas broader than the watchfire's light,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And redder than the bright moonbeam.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Even as Roland was quoting these lines to Annot
Drummond a wonderful but natural effect took place.
</p>

<p>
'Look, Roland,' cried she with a thrill of real terror;
'look, the chapel is on fire!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, impossible,' said he, still intent on gazing on her
sweet face.
</p>

<p>
'But look&mdash;look&mdash;it <i>is</i>!'
</p>

<p>
Whether she thought so or not Annot was evidently
startled and discomposed, while Roland certainly was not
without momentary astonishment.  A row of red lights
appeared through the branches of the dark trees high above
where he and Annot stood.  It was the last light of the
orange and blood-red set sun gleaming though the double
row of chapel windows&mdash;the rich red light that is peculiar
to Scottish sunsets, and the phenomenon it produced had a
powerful effect upon the vision and minds of the beholders&mdash;even
on the volatile and unimaginative Annot, who, before
the light faded out, was not slow to understand and to
utilize the situation in her own way.
</p>

<p>
She clung to Roland in an access of terror apparently,
and that it was more than partly simulated certainly he
never thought.  While seeming to be terrified by the ghostly
sight, she hid her face in his neck; and then Roland felt it
was all over with him!
</p>

<p>
'My darling&mdash;my darling, do not be so alarmed&mdash;it is
only a transient sunset effect,' said he, kissing her cheek.
</p>

<p>
'Don't, Roland, don't&mdash;oh, you must not do that,' she
murmured.
</p>

<p>
But Roland did <i>that</i>, again and again&mdash;pressing his lips
to her eyes, her rippling hair&mdash;covering her face with kisses,
while he half lifted, half led her homeward, up the steep and
winding path to Merlwood, which they reached, as said, at
a somewhat later period than usual.
</p>

<p>
'Well,' thought Hester, as she bathed her face and eyes
to remove all traces of her late emotion, 'in three days I
shall, for a time at least, see and hear no more of this.  And
yet&mdash;my heart will speak&mdash;I have loved <i>him</i>&mdash;all my life&mdash;ever
since he was a boy; and she has known him, as it were,
but yesterday!'
</p>

<p>
She put a hand to her forehead and pushed back the rings
and rows of heavy brown hair, as if their weight oppressed
her.
</p>

<p>
'Thank Heaven!' she thought, 'I can make my life a
useful and a busy one, even here.  Thank Heaven for the
refuge of another love, with work and duty&mdash;love and duty
to papa, and work for my poor people and their little ones!
But why, oh why,' she added, while interlacing her fingers
behind her neck, and looking round her wildly, 'did he love
her after <i>all</i>?&mdash;why turn from me to her&mdash;that little
golden-haired doll, with her winning ways and heartless nature; and
how comes it that her languorous green eyes have power to
awake such a passion as filled every accent of Roland's voice
in the gloaming there?  She came when she was not wanted;
and both are cruel, heartless, treacherous!'
</p>

<p>
But, to do Annot justice, she knew nothing then of the
tender relations that had begun to exist between Hester and
her cousin, though we do not suppose that the knowledge
would have much influenced that enterprising young lady in
her plans and views, her wishes and purpose.
</p>

<p>
Hester felt that she had been ready enough&mdash;too ready,
she now feared&mdash;to show him all her own heart, till that
other girl came, and she thought till now that it had frozen
up under Annot's presence and too evident influence on him.
</p>

<p>
That evening she did not appear at dinner, but sent
excuses downstairs, and refused to receive even a visit from
Annot.  That would have been indeed too much to have
undergone; but anon the mental storm passed away; the
ruddy dawn stole into Hester's bedroom, and she rested her
weary head against the open window to inhale the fresh
morning breeze that came up the woody valley of the Esk,
and over parterres of dewy flowers that were sweet enough to
grace the bank whereon the Queen of Elfin slept.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
That day she saw on Annot's mystic finger&mdash;the fourth of
the left hand&mdash;a ring she had not observed before, and knew
who was the donor, and what the gift meant, but the
knowledge could not give her a keener pang.  She thought of
Roland's gift, and of the emotions that had filled her heart
when he had clasped it round her neck.  She could not
return that gift to Roland without some reason; and she
apparently had none; but yet its retention was most repugnant
to her, and never would she wear it.  He had given it
to her as his cousin&mdash;nothing more, now it would seem.
Did he mean it so, <i>then</i>?
</p>

<p>
The dainty slippers, with blue embroidery on buff leather,
which had formed a portion of her daily and loving work,
were relinquished now and cast aside, too probably to be
never finished.
</p>

<p>
Hester Maule felt all the shame and sorrow of loving one
in secret, whose heart and preference were given to another.
What evil turn of Destiny had wrought this for her?  Why
had she so mistaken&mdash;if she <i>had</i> indeed done so&mdash;his
mere playful, cousinly regard for aught else than its true
value?
</p>

<p>
Yet&mdash;yet there had been times&mdash;especially on that night
when he gave her the jewels&mdash;that a gleam of tenderness, of
yearning, of love had lit up his dark eyes&mdash;an expression
that had gone straight to her heart and made every nerve
thrill.  Why had she not guessed then&mdash;why not foreseen
what was to happen?  But the <i>future</i> is always oddly woven
up with the <i>present</i>, we are told; and 'how strange are the
small threads that first begin to spin the great woofs of our
life story&mdash;unnoted, unheeded at the time&mdash;they stand out
clearly and plainly to our mental vision afterwards, and we
ask ourselves with bitter anguish, "Why did we not guess&mdash;why
did we not foresee it?"  Better, perhaps, that the power
of prevision is denied us, since we can neither alter nor
avert the doom that awaits us along the path of life.'
</p>

<p>
We do not mean to palliate or defend the indecision&mdash;change
of love and regard&mdash;on the part of Roland Lindsay;
but Hester had been from his earliest years so much of a
younger sister to him, that, though loving, winning, and
gentle, this golden-haired girl, with all her <i>espièglerie</i>, her
bold little speeches, and pretty touches and tricks of manner,
came as a new experience to him; and for the present
certainly, to all appearance, had enslaved and bewildered him,
dazzling his fancy to say the least of it.
</p>

<p>
Despite all her efforts, Hester, if she completely controlled
her manner, could not conceal her pain; thus her eyes
seemed dull, even sunken, and harsh lines marred the usual
sweetness of her lips.  If Roland noted these signs, he
strove to ignore them.  Annot had artfully instilled some
petty jealous suspicions of young Skene of Dunnimarle in
Roland's mind, and he sought mentally to make these a kind
of apology to himself, while seeming indifferent to what the
girl might suffer, even when her presence (despite the
arrangement for secrecy she had overheard) scarcely at times
interfered with the <i>sotto voce</i> babble of their lover-like but
inane conversation.
</p>

<p>
To Hester it seemed as if she was in a bad dream, but
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'It was no dream, and she was desolate.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.
</h3>

<p>
So Roland Lindsay was engaged to Annot Drummond.
Hester could have no doubt about that when she saw the
ring upon her mystic finger; and she supposed rightly that
till he could ascertain definitely 'how the land lay' at
Earlshaugh nothing further was arranged, and at last, to her
supreme satisfaction&mdash;an emotion she once never thought to
feel, so far as Roland was concerned&mdash;the day of his
departure for Fifeshire came.
</p>

<p>
'I must turn up at Earlshaugh now,' said he, when the
last evening came.  'I have asked Jack Elliot, Skene, and
one or two other fellows, over for the covert shooting; and
also, I suppose, I shall have to give my attention to
Mr. Hawkey Sharpe in the matters of subsoil and drainage,
mangold wurzel, and all that sort of thing.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't think he will trouble you much on these matters,'
said Sir Harry dryly.
</p>

<p>
'Why, uncle?'
</p>

<p>
'You will find that he deems them his own peculiar
province and <i>interest</i> too,' replied Sir Harry, with a lowering
expression of eye; and that his once jolly old uncle's manner
was now somewhat cool to him Roland was unpleasantly
sensible: and when the evening drew on, and, knowing that
he would depart betimes in the morning, he had to bid
Hester farewell, something of regret&mdash;even remorse&mdash;came
across his mind.  He suspected too surely all she had been
led to hope of him in the past&mdash;the love he could not give
her now, at least; and he strove to affect a light bearing to
her, and appear his old <i>insouciant</i> self, while thinking over
Annot's instilled suspicions.
</p>

<p>
'Skene!' he muttered; 'was my regard for Hester a
passing infatuation, or an old revived fancy?  Was it likely to
have proved a lasting attachment if Annot had not come?
And in Hester would I have but received the worn-out
remnant of an attachment for another?  Do not look so
strange&mdash;so white, cousin,' said he in a low voice, as he
touched her hand.
</p>

<p>
'White am I?' asked Hester with inexpressible annoyance;
'if so, it is caused by anxiety for papa&mdash;he is not strong,
Roland.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course,' glad to affect or adopt any idea; 'but always
trust to me&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'To <i>you</i>!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; we have ever been friends, and shall be so
always, I hope, for I never forget that I am your cousin,
though the privileges of such might turn a wiser head than
mine,' he added, unwisely, awkwardly, and with a little
laugh.
</p>

<p>
A gleam came into Hester's eyes, which always looked
nearly as black as night, and there was an angry curl on her
red lip for a moment.
</p>

<p>
Bewildered&mdash;besotted, in fact&mdash;though Roland had become,
by the wiles, graces, and beauty of the brilliant Annot, it was
impossible for him not to feel, we say, some compunction,
and keenly too, for his treatment of the soft and gentle
Hester.  He could not and dared not in any fashion approach
so delicate a subject with her&mdash;explanation or exculpation
was not to be thought of; yet he felt reproach subtly in her
manner; he could read it in her eyes, strive to conceal her
emotions as she might; and confusion made him blunder
again.
</p>

<p>
'Hester, we part but for a few days,' said he in a low
voice, and with more <i>empressement</i> of manner than he had
adopted for some time past; 'we have ever been excellent
friends, have we not, my dear girl? and now we shall be
more so than ever.'
</p>

<p>
Hester remained silent.  'Why now, more than ever?'
thought she, while his half-apologetic tone irritated and cut
her to the heart, and she knew that a much more tender
leave-taking with Annot was over and had taken place unseen;
and now, indulging in dreamy thoughts of her own, that
young lady was idling over the keys of the piano.
</p>

<p>
'Will you miss me when I am gone?' he asked, with a
little nervous smile.
</p>

<p>
'No doubt you will be missed&mdash;by papa especially.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I hope so.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'It is nice to feel one's self important to others,' said he.
with another awkward attempt at a jest; adding, 'May I?'
as he lighted a cigar.
</p>

<p>
She grew paler still; for a moment he looked sorrowfully
into her white-lidded and velvety dark blue eyes, and
attempted to touch her hand, but she shrank back.
</p>

<p>
'I should like,' he began, 'to stay a little longer, of course,
but I must go; the covert shooting is at hand, and
Earlshaugh must wait me.'
</p>

<p>
'It is more than some do there, papa thinks.'
</p>

<p>
'The more reason for me to go, cousin,' said he, with
darkening face.
</p>

<p>
'Go&mdash;and the sooner the better,' thought Hester bitterly;
'there is now no middle course for me&mdash;for us; we must be
everything or nothing to each other&mdash;and nothing it is!'
</p>

<p>
'Good-night, Hester dear,' said he, still lingering.  'Adieu,
Annot.  I shall be off to-morrow by gunfire, as we say in
barracks, when all are asleep in Merlwood.'
</p>

<p>
'Good-night.'
</p>

<p>
And so they parted, but not finally.
</p>

<p>
Early though the hour next day, Hester was too active by
habit, too much of a housewife, and too kind of heart to
permit him to depart without being down betimes to give him
a cup of coffee and to see him ere he went, despite his
laboured apologies.  How fresh and bright Hester seemed
in her white morning dress, with all its frills&mdash;fresh from her
bath, and both clear-skinned and fair, as only a dark-haired
and dark-eyed girl usually looks at such a time, requiring
none of that powdering and other odious process now known
as 'making up.'  Annot's low curtains remained closely
drawn, and there was no sign of that young lady, for the sun
was barely over the woods of Hawthornden.
</p>

<p>
Hester tendered her soft cheek for Roland's farewell
salute, and carried it bravely off&mdash;better even than he did,
as with a wave of the hand he was driven away.
</p>

<p>
He was gone&mdash;<i>gone</i>, and had ceased to be hers.  Lingeringly
the girl looked around her.  To Hester every flower
and shrub in the garden seemed to have a voice and say
so.  Every inanimate object told her so again and again.
Fragments of his cigar lay about the gravel walks; there yet
swung his hammock between the trees; and there was
almost no task she could attempt now that was not associated
with him, and, worse than all, with Annot Drummond.
</p>

<p>
Long did Hester sit on a garden sofa, as the former could
see from her window, while brushing out her marvellous
hair&mdash;sit with cold and locked hands and pathetic eyes,
motionless and miserable, as she listened like one in a dream
to the singing of the birds, the humming of the bees around
her, and the pleasant murmur of her native Esk.
</p>

<p>
The fair and beautiful girl saw this and knew the cause
thereof; yet in her great love and passion, if not in her
artful design, she was pitiless!
</p>

<p>
She was too well trained, she thought, by her mother to
be otherwise.  Taught from her cradle to look upon wealth,
and all that wealth could obtain, as the chief object of life,
she had from the days of her short frocks and plaited hair,
heard only of 'excellent matches,' of 'moneyed marriages,'
and 'eligible men,' and so her mind was framed in another
world from Hester's.
</p>

<p>
Men, thought the latter, cared little for a love that was
easily won, she had read.  Perhaps Roland valued hers
lightly thus.  Well, she would assert herself&mdash;might even
go to Earlshaugh, meet him beneath his own roof, and in
his own home show herself that she was heart-whole, could
she but act the part her innate pride suggested.
</p>

<p>
At first she avoided Annot, whom she heard hourly idling
over the piano; she felt, amid all her crushing and mortifying
thoughts, that she would be happier if busy, and so she
bustled about the house affecting to be dreadfully so; tied
up, let down, snipped, and twined rose-bushes in the garden,
and strove to look happy and cheerful, with a sick and sinking
heart&mdash;even attempting to sing, but her voice failed her.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the frivolous, emotional, and perhaps
somewhat sensuous nature of Annot required change, society,
and above all some exciting incident to keep her even in
tolerable humour and mental health; and now that she had
no companion at Merlwood but Hester and her old uncle,
with his inevitable hookah and Indian small talk, she became
unmistakably <i>triste</i> and fidgety, impatient and absent&mdash;only
awake and radiant when the postman was expected.  She
felt utterly bored by Merlwood now, and could not conceal
her impatience to fulfil her visit to Earlshaugh.
</p>

<p>
'I quite look forward to that event,' said she.
</p>

<p>
'No doubt,' assented Hester.
</p>

<p>
'It will be so delightful&mdash;a country house full of people,
and mamma not there to watch and scold me in private.'
</p>

<p>
'For what?'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, you should see or hear her after she has caught me
idling much with a detrimental, or daring to leave my hand
in his for a moment.'
</p>

<p>
'Annot!'
</p>

<p>
'I fear that I am a natural born flirt, Hester.'
</p>

<p>
The latter made no reply, as she thought, a little disdainfully,
that these would-be artless speeches were merely meant
to 'cast dust in her eyes,' and with regard to her own visit
to Fifeshire, she was seldom twice in the same mood of mind.
</p>

<p>
'Invited to Earlshaugh&mdash;to meet, see, and associate hourly
with him, and with <i>her</i>, too, there!' Hester would think.
'Better feign illness and stay at home&mdash;at sequestered
Merlwood; but that would only be putting off the evil day.  As
her kinsman, she must meet him some time and face it
boldly&mdash;meet him as little more than a friend, after all that
had passed between them, and he had left&mdash;unsaid!'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot make you and Roly&mdash;I mean Roland&mdash;out!'
said Annot on one occasion.
</p>

<p>
'How?' asked Hester.  'I do not understand you.'
</p>

<p>
'I always thought myself quick in discovering cases of
spoon&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Don't be slangy, Annot.'
</p>

<p>
'Slang or not, you know the phrase and all it expresses!'
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'When I first came here I made up my mind that Roland
was entirely yours, though I could not be sure whether you
returned his regard; but after being with you both for nearly
a month, I find myself quite at a loss.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you?' said Hester icily.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;you parted last night without the least sign of
regret or emotion, and all that sort of thing.'
</p>

<p>
'How dare she attempt to quiz me thus?' thought Hester,
feeling almost that she could strike the smiling little speaker;
'how dare she?&mdash;but she knows not all I know&mdash;all I was
compelled to overhear!'
</p>

<p>
So, as days passed on, beyond dark shadows under her
eyes, the result of broken nights, there was little bodily sign
of what Hester endured mentally.
</p>

<p>
'Why, Hester, you have really and truly received a letter
at last from Earlshaugh!' exclaimed Annot one morning, to
Hester's annoyance and pique, as the former quickly
recognised the coat of arms and post-mark; and that Annot, who
received missives from the same source daily, should jest
over the event, made Hester, with all her innate gentleness
of heart, almost hate the speaker.
</p>

<p>
It was from Roland at last, thanking her and Sir Harry
for their great kindness to him, and hoping to see her and
Annot Drummond together at Earlshaugh at the time
proposed.
</p>

<p>
Nothing more!
</p>

<p>
'Go to Earlshaugh&mdash;no&mdash;no!' was again Hester's first
thought, with a kind of shudder; 'to be with <i>them</i>
morning, noon, and evening&mdash;the feeling would madden
me&mdash;yet how am I to excuse myself?'
</p>

<p>
'You never go from home now, papa,' she took an opportunity
of saying as she wound her soft arms round Sir Harry's
time-silvered head and drew it down upon her breast; 'and
seldom though I do so, I wish to escape this visit to
Earlshaugh&mdash;I am most loth to leave you.'
</p>

<p>
'For a few weeks&mdash;a few miles' distance!'
</p>

<p>
'But who will take my place when I am gone?  Who will
make your breakfast so early, cut the papers, and brighten
up the fire for you&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'The housekeeper, of course.'
</p>

<p>
'Deck the room with flowers; walk with you along the
woody paths by the river?  Who will read, play, and sing
to you at night?  I do not wish to go at all, papa&mdash;let Annot
go alone.'
</p>

<p>
'Nonsense, girl!  I shall miss you, of course, but it is
only for a time,' said her father, who knew and felt well that
it was in the nature of Hester to think and anticipate his
every wish, and do all that in its truest and holiest sense
made Merlwood a <i>home</i> for him.
</p>

<p>
'You are not worrying yourself about anything, dear?'
said the old gentleman, who had his own thoughts on the
matter, as he put an arm caressingly round her, and eyed
her anxiously.
</p>

<p>
'Of course not, papa,' replied Hester with assumed
briskness; 'about what should I worry?'
</p>

<p>
'Little troubles look big at times,' said he, laying his head
back in his easy-chair.
</p>

<p>
Her trouble was not a little one, however, and while
pursuing his own thoughts her father made her pale cheek
grow paler still.
</p>

<p>
'Annot seems to have taken a great fancy to Roland;
but the fancies of town-bred girls are often mere moonshine.'
</p>

<p>
'Not the fancies of such girls as Annot, with a home-like
Earlshaugh in prospective,' said Hester, with a forced laugh,
as she recalled Annot's several confidences.
</p>

<p>
'Ah!' muttered the old gentleman dubiously, while tugging
his wiry white moustache; 'still, it may be a fancy that
will pass,' he continued, still pursuing his own thoughts;
'and things always come right in the end.'
</p>

<p>
'On the stage and in novels, papa,' replied Hester,
laughing outright.
</p>

<p>
'But they <i>do</i> wind up rightly, dear, even in real life
sometimes.'
</p>

<p>
'You know, papa, it is always said that no man ever
marries his first love.'
</p>

<p>
'It may be so, Hester&mdash;it may be so; but one thing you
may be sure of, if he is a true man.'
</p>

<p>
'And that is&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'He never can forget her.'
</p>

<p>
Sir Harry's eyes kindled, and his voice grew soft as he
said this; for his thoughts were wandering away to the wife
of his youth&mdash;she who now lay in the old kirkyard above
the Esk&mdash;and of whom Hester seemed then a living
reproduction, or the old man thought so; and when he spoke
thus in the love and chivalry of his heart, he revived in
Hester a moth-like desire to go to Earlshaugh after all, such
is the idiosyncrasy of human nature; and as some one has
it, 'to suffer that self-immolation, which is common to
unhappy lovers.  She longed to see Roland once more'&mdash;to
feast her eyes upon the man who seemed happy with
another, no matter what the after-pain might be.
</p>

<p>
What she meant to say or do, or how to look&mdash;when this
new fancy seized her&mdash;she knew not.  She only knew
that&mdash;meanly, she thought&mdash;she hungered and thirsted for the
sound of his voice and a glance of his eyes, before,
perhaps, he&mdash;even as the husband of Annot Drummond&mdash;went
to Egypt or elsewhere, it might be to return, perhaps,
no more.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, that 'fair one with the golden locks' was all
feverish impatience till the time came for quitting Merlwood,
and had no doubt that Roland would cross the Forth to
meet her.
</p>

<p>
'You seem strangely interested in the movements of
Roland,' said Sir Harry rather grimly to her.
</p>

<p>
'He is almost half a cousin, is he not, uncle?' said
Annot, in her most cooing and caressing way; 'but no one
would think me so foolish as to lose my heart to a mere
cousin.'
</p>

<p>
'None will suspect you of such a loss, indeed,' observed
Hester, with some pardonable bitterness, as she recalled all
she had so unwillingly overheard in the shrubbery on that
eventful evening.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
ROLAND'S HOME-COMING.
</h3>

<p>
Let us return to the day of Roland Lindsay's departure
from Merlwood, when full of thoughts of a sorrowful cast,
and perhaps in the frame described by Wordsworth as
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'That sweet mood when pleasant thoughts<br />
  Bring sad thoughts to the mind.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A letter that had come for him overnight&mdash;one from
Annot's mother in South Belgravia&mdash;he scanned twice
hurriedly, and consigned to his pocket.  Annot, in that
quarter, had made no secret, apparently, of the terms on
which he and she were, and the congratulations of the old
lady were palpable enough.
</p>

<p>
'What is next?' he muttered, as he opened a little basket
and laughed.  It contained sandwiches and sherry, peaches,
grapes, and a little bouquet of hot-house flowers, all selected,
he knew, by the white hands of Hester.
</p>

<p>
'Poor girl!' he muttered; 'does she think I am bound,
not for Earlshaugh, but for Alexandria?'
</p>

<p>
He had beautifully-coloured photos of both girls in his
pocket book&mdash;one of Annot, smiling, saucy, and arch, with
her laughing eyes and golden hair; and one of Hester, with
her calm, sweet expression, her dark, beseeching, and
pleading eyes, and hair of rich dark brown; but he had one of
the former's fair tresses&mdash;not the first of them that Annot
had bestowed on 'Bob Hoyle' and others that he knew not
of.  But so it is&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Fair tresses man's imperial race ensnare,<br />
  And beauty draws us with a single hair.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Merlwood had vanished as the train sped on, and, away
from the immediate influence of Annot, softer memories of
Hester began to mingle upbraidingly with the idea of the
former, and&mdash;as he thought it all over again&mdash;the past; he
recurred mentally to many a loving and half-ended episode,
to Hester's winning softness, her pleading, truthful eyes of
violet blue, and he felt himself, though uncommitted by
pledge or promise, inexpressibly false!
</p>

<p>
It was not a pleasant reflection or conviction even while
caressing Annot's shining tress of hair&mdash;his tempter and her
supplanter.
</p>

<p>
Some men, it has been said, when they form a new
attachment, try to teach themselves that the old one
contained no true love in it.  This was not the case with
Roland, nor could he be a man to love two at once,
though some natures are thought to be capable of such
an idiosyncrasy.
</p>

<p>
At last he was roused from his mingled day-dreams by
his train clanking into the Waverley Station, and he saw
Edinburgh, the old town and the new, with gables, spires,
and tower-crowned rocks rising on each side of him, with a
mighty bridge of round arches high in air spanning the
space between.
</p>

<p>
The day was yet young, so he idled for a time at the
United Service Club with Jack Elliot, his comrade in Egypt,
on leave like himself, and now his sister Maude's <i>fiancé</i>, a
fine, handsome, and soldier-like young fellow, of whom
more anon&mdash;full of such earnest love and enthusiasm for
the girl of his unwavering choice, that Roland&mdash;reflecting
on his late proceedings at Merlwood&mdash;felt his cheek redden
more than once, as well it might, and an involuntary sigh
escaped him, though he could little foresee the <i>future</i>.
</p>

<p>
So full was he of his own thoughts, that it was not until
he was landing on the Fife side of the Forth that he reflected
with annoyance:
</p>

<p>
'What a fool I have been, when in the city, not to call
upon old MacWadsett, the W.S., about the exact terms of
my father's will.  They never reached me in Egypt&mdash;the
Bedouins at Ramleh made free with the mail-bags.  Besides,
I need not have gone before this, as the old fellow
has been on the Continent.'
</p>

<p>
So he consoled himself with the inevitable cigar, while the
train rolled on by many a familiar scene, on which he had
not looked for an age, as it seemed now; by the 'lang, lang
town' of Kirkaldy, and picturesque Dysart, with its zigzag
streets, overlooked by the gaunt dwelling-place of Queen
Annabella, and the sea-beaten rock of Ravenscraig; anon
past Falkland Woods, and after he crossed the Eden he
began to trace the landmarks of Earlshaugh, and the train
halted at a little wayside station, close beside an old and
almost unused avenue that led to the latter, and he sprang
out upon the platform, where he seemed to be the only
passenger.  The two or three officials who were loitering
about were strangers, and eyed him leisurely.
</p>

<p>
'Has not a trap come for my luggage?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'For where, sir?'
</p>

<p>
'Earlshaugh.'
</p>

<p>
'No sir,' replied one, touching his cap, an ex-soldier
recognising his questioner's military air.  'No trap is here.'
</p>

<p>
'Strange!' muttered Roland, giving his moustache an
angry twist; 'and yet I wrote&mdash;I'll walk on, and send for
my things,' he added.
</p>

<p>
The house was little more than a mile distant, and every
foot of the way had been familiar to him from infancy.
</p>

<p>
On many a strange and foreign scene had he looked, and
many a peril had he faced, in the land of the Pharaohs
since last he had trod that shady avenue&mdash;the land of the
Sphinx and the Pyramids, where the hot sand of the desert
seemed to vibrate and quiver under the fierce glare of the
unclouded sun.
</p>

<p>
Forgetful of old superstitions, he had entered the avenue
by the Weird Yett.  It was deemed unlucky for a Lindsay
of Earlshaugh to approach his house after a long absence
through that barrier; but as the gate was open, Roland, full
of his own thoughts, passed in, heedless of the legend which
told that the Lindsay fared ill who did so.
</p>

<p>
Two stone pillars, dated 1600, with an arch and coat of
arms with the Lindsay supporters, two lions sejant, termed
the barrier, which was usually closed by a massive iron gate,
the barbs or pikes of which had once been gilt.  A century
later had seen it the favourite trysting-place of Roland
Lindsay, the younger, of Earlshaugh, and a daughter of a
neighbour, the Laird of Craigie Hall, till the former left
with his regiment, the Scots Guards, for Spain.  One evening
the girl was lingering there, in the soft violet light of the
gloaming, impelled by what emotion she scarcely knew, but
doubtless to dream of her lover who she thought was far
away, when suddenly a cry escaped her, as she saw him
appear, in his scarlet uniform, with feather-bound hat&mdash;the
Monmouth cock&mdash;his flowing wig, and sword in its splendid
belt; but gouts of blood were upon his lace cravat, and she
could see that his face was sad and pale, as face and figure
melted away and she found herself alone.
</p>

<p>
Apparitions generally 'come in their habits as they lived,'
says the authoress of the 'Night side of Nature,' 'and
appear so much like the living person in the flesh that when
they are not known to be dead, they are frequently mistaken
for them.  There are exceptions to this rule, but it is very
rare that the forms in themselves exhibit anything to create
alarm.'
</p>

<p>
So did the girl's lover appear to her as if alive.
</p>

<p>
With a power of reason beyond her years and time, she
tried to think&mdash;could it be a dream of her excited brain?
But no, she was awake with all her senses; she thought of
the blood on his dress, and the awful knowledge came to
her, that she had looked upon the face of the dead&mdash;on the
wraith of her lover&mdash;who, a month after she learned, had
perished at that very hour and time, shot by the Spaniards
on the fatal field of Almanza.
</p>

<p>
'The divine arts of priming and gunpowder have frightened
away Robin Goodfellow and the Fairies,' wrote Sir
John Aubery of old; but the ghost of the Weird Yett
lingered long in the unused avenue of Earlshaugh.
</p>

<p>
When he did recall the terror of his boyhood, Roland
smiled; but kindly, for every feature round him spoke of
<i>home</i>.  Seen through the tree-stems was the old thatched
hamlet of Earlshaugh, on the side of a burn crossed by one
huge stone as a bridge&mdash;the hamlet where the clatter of the
weaver's loom still lingered even in these days of steam
appliances, and on the humble doors of which the old
Scottish risp or tirling-pin was to be seen as elsewhere in the
East Neuk; and as he looked at the gray fallen monolith by
which the stream was crossed, he thought of the old song
which seemed to describe it:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Yet it had a bluirdly look,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some score o' years ago,<br />
  An' the wee burn seemed a river then,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it roared doon below;<br />
  And a bauld bairn was he,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the merry days lang gane,<br />
  Wha waded through the burn,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aneath the auld brig-stane.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And, as if to complete the picture, an old woman, wearing
one of those white mutches, with the modest black band of
widowhood, introduced by Mary of Guelders, sat on a
'divot-seat' knitting at the sunny end of her little thatched
cottage.
</p>

<p>
A love of his birthplace and a pride in his historic race
were the strongest features in the character of Roland
Lindsay, and Earlshaugh was certainly such a home as any
man might be pardoned for regarding with something of
enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
As he looked upon the old manor house, high, square,
and embattled, towering on its grassy steep above the haugh&mdash;that
abode of so many memories, with all his pride in it,
and pride of race and name, there came a stormy emotion,
or sense of humiliation&mdash;even of rage, when he thought of
the tenor or alleged tenor of that will, by which his father,
in the senility of age (if all he heard were true), had degraded
him to a cypher by leaving the estate entirely to an alien, to
his second wife, who had been the artful companion of his
first&mdash;to the exclusion of him&mdash;Roland, the heir of line and
blood, save for such a pittance or allowance as she chose to
accord him, for the term of his or her natural life, which,
when the chances of war and climate were considered, was
certain to exceed his own, his senior though she was in years.
</p>

<p>
After all he had endured in the deserts by the Nile,
hunger, thirst, suffering, sickness, and wounds, facing and
enduring all that a soldier may since last he had looked on old,
gray Earlshaugh, as memory went flashing back he strove to
forget for a brief time the wrong his father had done himself
and his sister Maude, and to think only of his happy
boyhood, and all that had been then.
</p>

<p>
Memories of his dead parents, of his gentle and loving
mother, of his manly and fox-hunting father, who had taught
him to ride, and shoot, and fish&mdash;of little brothers who lay
buried by their side in the grave&mdash;of his childhood, of
games, and old&mdash;or rather young&mdash;longings and imaginings,
when the woods of Earlshaugh, and the trouting stream,
were objects of vague mystery, the former peopled with
fairies, and the latter the abode of a wicked kelpie!
</p>

<p>
Many a living voice and loving face had passed away since
then&mdash;vanished for ever; but the memories of them were
strong and pathetic.  The rooks still clamoured in the old
trees, and the birds sang amid the shrubberies as of old;
he heard the men whistling and singing in the stable-yard.
In the fields the soil had a fresh and grassy odour in
the noonday sunshine familiar to him; and he felt the
conviction that though he in many a sense had changed, Nature
had not&mdash;'for the wind blows as it will through all the long
years, and the land wakes glad and fragrant at the kiss of
the pale dawn, and plain daily labour goes on steadily and
unheedingly from generation to generation.'
</p>

<p>
As unnoticed and unseen he drew near the house&mdash;a
massive old Scottish fortalice with tourelles at every angle&mdash;and
surveyed its striking façade, he recalled the words of his
uncle and Hester, and felt that he had now much that was
practical to think about, much that was painful and dubious
to forgive or submit to, while a vague sense of coming bitter
annoyance&mdash;it might be humiliation, as we have said&mdash;rose
before his haughty spirit, and the suspicion or emotion was
not long of being put to the test.
</p>

<p>
A man with his hands in the back pockets of his coat, his
hat set negligently into the nape of his neck&mdash;a thickset,
well-to-do, little fellow, about thirty years of age, clad in a
kind of semi-sporting style, with a straw in his mouth and
much display of jewellery at his waistcoat&mdash;came leisurely
down the front steps from a <i>porte-cochère</i>, which the late
Laird had added to the old house&mdash;leisurely, we say, and
with a very <i>insouciant</i> air, and accorded a nod&mdash;bow it could
not be called&mdash;to Roland and paused.
</p>

<p>
'Oh,' said he, 'Captain Lindsay, I presume?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied the other, with surprise, and curtly.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, welcome; we've been expecting you.  Did you
walk from the station?'
</p>

<p>
'I was obliged to do so&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Ah.'
</p>

<p>
'And you, sir?' asked Roland inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Sharpe&mdash;Hawkey Sharpe, at your service.'
</p>

<p>
'The new steward?' said Roland, repressing a vehement
desire to kick him along the terrace.
</p>

<p>
'If you please to call me so.'
</p>

<p>
('What the devil else does he think I should call him?'
thought Roland.)
</p>

<p>
As Mr. Hawkey Sharpe neither touched nor lifted his hat
Roland ignored his tardily proffered hand, which was
replaced in his coat pocket.
</p>

<p>
'Had a pleasant morning journey, I hope.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, I am just going to the stables&mdash;all are well at home,'
said this strange and very confident personage, passing on,
while Roland stood for a moment rooted to the ground by
the profound <i>insouciance</i> of the man; but from <i>that</i> moment
there was a secret, if unnamed, hatred of each other in the
eyes of these two&mdash;hate blended with contempt and indignation
in those of Roland, who felt intuitively that the other,
though, as he supposed, his underling, would yet work him
a mischief if he could.
</p>

<p>
'D&mdash;n the fellow!' thought Roland.  'So this is
Mr. Sharpe.  I must put him to the rightabout!  He ought to
have ushered me in or preceded me.'
</p>

<p>
He rang the bell furiously.
</p>

<p>
A strange footman appeared promptly enough, but without
the indignation a 'London Jeames' would have manifested
at a summons so rough and impatient; for natheless his
irreproachable livery and powdered hair, he had been born
and bred in the East Neuk of Fife, and had no 'West-End'
airs about him.
</p>

<p>
'All are strangers now hereabout,' thought Roland, who
was about to enter, when the man distinctly barred his
way.
</p>

<p>
'Name, sir, please?' said he.
</p>

<p>
'Is Miss Maude&mdash;Miss Lindsay, I mean&mdash;at home?'
</p>

<p>
'No, sir; out riding.'
</p>

<p>
'Your mistress, then?' said Roland sharply.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir&mdash;if you will give me a card.'
</p>

<p>
'Card, ha!' exclaimed Roland, losing his temper now,
and with fury blazing in his dark eyes.  'Say that Captain
Lindsay has arrived!'
</p>

<p>
On this the valet&mdash;Tom Trotter by name&mdash;threw the
door wide open, with a grin of welcome not unmingled with
astonishment and alarm, and Roland found himself again
under the roof of Earlshaugh.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap11"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
A COLD RECEPTION.
</h3>

<p>
Roland found himself somewhat ceremoniously ushered
into a drawing-room with which he was familiar, and which
was known as the Red Room, where he was left at leisure
for a few minutes, to look about him and reflect.
</p>

<p>
The second Mrs. Lindsay had been too wise, he could
perceive, to remove much of the ancient furniture of the
manor house, but she had interspersed it with much that
was modern; large easy seats and rich hangings, gipsy
tables, Chippendale chairs, and great rugs, Parian statuary,
and one or two antique classic busts, had caught Roland's
eye as he passed along; but all old portraits were banished
to the staircases and corridors, for it had seemed to the
intruder on their domains that the grim old Lindsays in ruff
and breastplate, with hand on hip and sword in belt, with
their dames in hoops and old-fashioned Scottish fardingales,
had rather scowled upon her.
</p>

<p>
The Red Room of Earlshaugh had been one of the 'show
places' in the East Neuk, for nearly all its furniture was of
red lacquer work, brought from Japan by a Lindsay in the
close of the last century.  The walls were hung with stamped
leather, the golden tints of which had faded now, though the
gilding gleamed out here and there, and against this sobered
background the richly tinted furniture, with its painted suns,
moons, and stars, grotesque monsters, and queerly designed
houses and gardens, stood out redly and boldly, with bronzes,
marbles, and ivory carvings now yellow with age.
</p>

<p>
It was noon now, and through the open and deeply embayed
windows the perfume of many flowers stole in from
the gardens below, mingling with that from roses and others
that were in the <i>jardinières</i>, and to Roland it all seemed as
if he had stood there only yesterday.
</p>

<p>
There was a sound; he turned and found himself face to
face with his stepmother, whom he had last seen and known
as his own mother's useful, bland, suave, apparently patient
and always obsequious companion.
</p>

<p>
'Welcome, Roland, at last,' said she; but there was no
welcome either in her voice or eye, though she accorded him
her hand, and a kiss that was as cold as the expression of
her face, though it was apparent that she was trying to get
up a pathetic look for the occasion; in fact, she felt the
necessity for a little acting&mdash;of assuming a virtue, if she had
it not&mdash;and Roland saw and understood the whole situation
at once, for after a few commonplaces, and he had flung
himself into a chair that had once been a favourite one of his
father, she asked:
</p>

<p>
'How long does your leave of absence from the regiment
last?'
</p>

<p>
'So shortly,' replied Roland with an undisguised sneer,
'that I won't mar your pleasure or spoil your appetite by
telling its duration.'
</p>

<p>
At this reply she coloured for a moment, and thought,
'We have here an independent and conceited young man,
who must be kept at his proper distance.'  But she only
caressed Fifine, an odious little pug dog, which she carried
under her arm.
</p>

<p>
And avoiding all family matters, which, sooth to say,
Roland disdained to discuss with her, even his father's death,
more than all the alleged terms of the odious will and
similar subjects, they talked the merest commonplaces&mdash;of
the weather, the crops, the country, and of the war in
Egypt&mdash;but all in a jerky and unconnected fashion, as each felt
that a moment might land them on that dangerous ground
which was inevitably to be traversed yet.
</p>

<p>
'And Maude?' said Roland during a pause; 'she must
be quite a grown-up young lady now.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, she is close on twenty; but I do not see much of
Maude.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'She stays away from Earlshaugh as much as she can, with
friends in Edinburgh, London, and elsewhere.'
</p>

<p>
While closely observing his stepmother, Roland was
compelled to admit to himself that she was ladylike.  In her
fortieth year, her hair was fair and thick; her stature good;
her hands well-shaped and white, but somewhat large.
</p>

<p>
Her face was perfectly colourless; her eyes small,
glittering, of the palest gray, planted near a thin and aquiline
nose; her lips were also thin, not ill-tempered, but like
her whole expression&mdash;hard.  Her teeth were small and
sharp-looking; her face lineless&mdash;she looked ten years
younger than she was, and was beautifully, even tastefully,
dressed.
</p>

<p>
She wore now, as she always did, a handsome-trimmed
black costume of the richest material, with a white cap of
fine lace, slightly trimmed with black, as a sign of widowhood,
and jet ornaments, with a few pearls among them.
</p>

<p>
'I do so long to see my dear little Maude!' exclaimed
Roland.
</p>

<p>
'You have been in no hurry to do so,' said Mrs. Lindsay,
with a cold smile.
</p>

<p>
'My uncle at Merlwood was so hospitable,' replied
Roland, reddening a little.  Could he say to Mrs. Lindsay
that <i>her</i> presence had kept him away from Earlshaugh to the
last moment, or refer to the new influence of Annot
Drummond on himself?  'By-the-bye,' said he abruptly, 'I
met a fellow at the door&mdash;Mr. Hawkey Sharpe by name, it
seems&mdash;who I understand has been installed here as a kind
of steward or general factotum.'
</p>

<p>
'What of him?'
</p>

<p>
'Only that I have made up my mind that he shall march
from this, and pretty quick too!'
</p>

<p>
'There may be some difficulties about that,' replied
Mrs. Lindsay, with a hectic flush crossing her pale cheek, and a
sharp glitter in her cold gray eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Difficulties&mdash;how?  With old MacWadsett?'
</p>

<p>
'With more than him.'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean?  By Jove, we shall soon see.'
</p>

<p>
'What we shall <i>see</i>,' muttered Mrs. Lindsay under her
sharp teeth; but Roland, who could not be perfectly suave
with her, now asked sharply:
</p>

<p>
'Why was there not a vehicle&mdash;trap&mdash;phaeton, or anything
else, sent to meet me at the station?'
</p>

<p>
'Was there none?' she asked languidly.
</p>

<p>
'None&mdash;and I had to leave my luggage there.'
</p>

<p>
'Dear me&mdash;how negligent&mdash;eh, Fifine, was it not?' said
she, toying with the ears of her cur.
</p>

<p>
'Negligent, indeed,' added Roland, his brow darkening.
'Yet I read your letter&mdash;or telegram was it?&mdash;to
Mr. Sharpe.'
</p>

<p>
'You read my letter to&mdash;Mr. Sharpe?'
</p>

<p>
'At least that portion of it referring to your return.'
</p>

<p>
'Mr.&mdash;what's his name?&mdash;Sharpe had better act up to his
cognomen while I have to do with him.  I am accustomed
to be obeyed.'
</p>

<p>
'Like the Centurion in the Scriptures&mdash;dear me!'
</p>

<p>
'Exactly,' said Roland, feeling that there was mockery in
her tone or thoughts.
</p>

<p>
'If not?'
</p>

<p>
'We are accustomed to obedience in barracks, and enforce
it.  We have the guard-house to begin with.'
</p>

<p>
'An institution unknown in Earlshaugh,' said she, with a
curl on her lips.
</p>

<p>
'I have a number of friends coming here to knock over
the birds after the 1st&mdash;you will please to order arrangements
to be made for them.'
</p>

<p>
'A houseful&mdash;I have heard from Maude.'
</p>

<p>
'Not at all&mdash;only Elliot of ours, Skene of Dunnimarle,
and one or two more.  My cousin Hester and Miss
Drummond come too.'
</p>

<p>
'Must you do this&mdash;must I entertain them all?' said she
with something like dismay.
</p>

<p>
'You?  Not at all!  Let them alone&mdash;they will amuse
themselves as people in a country house always do.  Young
fellows and pleasant girls generally contrive to cut out their
own amusements.'
</p>

<p>
'I see so few people now that I shall be quite scared.'
</p>

<p>
'Let Maude act hostess then,' said Roland sharply, with
a tone that seemed to indicate he thought it more her
place.
</p>

<p>
'Maude is but a little child in my eyes&mdash;and none can
take my position in Earlshaugh!' said Mrs. Lindsay firmly
and pointedly; and Roland, tired of an interview, the
whole tenor of which provoked him, and in which an
undefined and ill-disguised hostility to himself was
manifested, looked at his watch and asked:
</p>

<p>
'Any chance of lunch, do you think?'
</p>

<p>
'Lunch?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.  When a fellow has travelled nearly forty miles in
a morning, and crossed the Firth, he wants something to
pick him up.'
</p>

<p>
'Lunch is past already,' said Mrs. Lindsay stiffly; 'but
ring the bell, please.'
</p>

<p>
She made no attempt with effusive hospitality to rise from
her seat.  That would have implied kindness, attention, and,
more than all, it would have involved exertion; and she was
contriving now to be one of those imperturbable creatures
who never allow themselves to be influenced or bored; and
when Roland withdrew to the familiar dining-room to partake
of the meal, and where he was welcomed by jolly old Simon
Funnell, his father's rubicund butler, with shining face and
outstretched hands, she did not accompany him; nor did
he observe, when he left her, how her pale face expressed
by turns dread, defiance, hatred, and more!
</p>

<p>
One would have supposed that the mere difference of sex
might have affected her, and made her disposed to view
favourably, and to greet pleasantly at least, the only son of
the man to whose folly she owed so much&mdash;a handsome
young fellow, whose face made even those of old women
brighten.  But it was not so; and thus bitterly did Roland
Lindsay feel that his home-coming, with all its sense of
irritation and humiliation, was such that, but for Maude and
those at Merlwood, he would have regretted that he did not
perish after Kashgate, when he lay helpless in the desert,
with the foul Egyptian vultures hovering over him.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
MAUDE.
</h3>

<p>
Lunch ended, Roland was lingering rather gloomily over a
glass of his father's old favourite Amontillado, which Simon
Funnell had disinterred from the cobwebby bins of the cellar
for his special delectation, when an exclamation made him
start; a pair of soft arms were thrown around his neck, and
a bright, fair face was pressed against his cheek.
</p>

<p>
'Maude!'
</p>

<p>
'Roland&mdash;Roland&mdash;you here! oh, such an unexpected
joy!' exclaimed his sister, a merry and impulsive girl, who
had just returned from riding, in bearing so smart, handsome,
and perfect in her hat and habit, as she tossed aside
her whip and gauntlets and embraced him again and again,
so effusively and affectionately that he felt an emotion of
welcome for the first time.
</p>

<p>
'I am here, Maude&mdash;but why did you not come to meet
me?' said he.
</p>

<p>
'I knew not that you were to be here to-day,' she replied,
with a sparkle in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Did your&mdash;did not Mrs. Lindsay tell you I was coming?'
</p>

<p>
'No,' replied Maude indignantly.
</p>

<p>
'Another act of coldness and unwelcome.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Roland&mdash;how I dread these people!'
</p>

<p>
'Who?'
</p>

<p>
'Mrs. Lindsay and her Mr. Sharpe!  I have just had a
spin over breezy Tentsmuirs, making the sheep and rabbits
fly before me, as you and I and Hester Maule have often
done before, Roland,' said Maude, changing abruptly from
grave to gay.
</p>

<p>
Full of health and spirits, with a soft rose-leaf complexion
that was heightened by recent exercise and present excitement,
she was a girl whose beauty was of a delicate type.
Her hair was of the sunniest brown, her eyes a soft and
dreamy blue, yet wont to beam and sparkle at times; her
figure was slight, extremely graceful, and she was now in her
twentieth year.
</p>

<p>
'By Jove, Maude, you have grown quite a little beauty!'
exclaimed Roland, while, holding each other at arm's length,
brother and sister surveyed each other's face; 'but in
expression you are not changed a bit.'
</p>

<p>
'Nor you, Roland&mdash;yet, how scorched&mdash;how brown you are!'
</p>

<p>
'That was done in Egypt&mdash;but much of it wore off at
Merlwood.'
</p>

<p>
'How long you have been of coming here, Roland!' said
Maude, with a pout on her ruby lip.
</p>

<p>
'Since returning to Britain, you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'Since returning to Scotland.'
</p>

<p>
'With all my love for you, my dear little sister, I was loth
to face the&mdash;the mortifications that I feared awaited me at
home.'
</p>

<p>
'A changed home, Roland!'
</p>

<p>
'If we can call it so.'
</p>

<p>
'But then at Merlwood,' said she archly, 'Hester&mdash;dear
Hester, would be an attraction, of course.'
</p>

<p>
Roland actually coloured, and stooped to scrape a cigar
light on his heel, and to change the subject said:
</p>

<p>
'I saw Jack Elliot of ours for a few minutes at his club in
Edinburgh.'
</p>

<p>
'Dear Jack! and how is he looking?'
</p>

<p>
'Well and jolly as usual; unluckily his leave is shorter
than mine, yet I hope to keep him here till the pheasants
are ready.'
</p>

<p>
'Darling Roland&mdash;how good of you!' exclaimed his
sister, kissing him again.
</p>

<p>
'You and he expect your little affair to come off
when&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'When the regiment returns home&mdash;I could not go out to
Egypt, you know, Roland.'
</p>

<p>
'Worse than useless, when we may be moving towards the
frontier again.'
</p>

<p>
'In her last letter to me Annot Drummond seemed full
of Egypt, and Egypt only.'
</p>

<p>
'She has a lover out there, perhaps&mdash;or going,' said
Roland, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'Not improbable.  She is coming here; but, truth to tell,
I do not like Annot Drummond much.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot say.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, Maude, that is unjust.'
</p>

<p>
'It is a case of Dr. Fell, I suppose.'
</p>

<p>
'Yet you have invited her for a month or two to Earlshaugh.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Why, then?'
</p>

<p>
'As a return for her mother's kindness to me when in
London&mdash;nothing more.  There is no love lost between
Annot and me.'
</p>

<p>
Roland became silent, as his sister evidently spoke
unwillingly; and to change the subject, he said:
</p>

<p>
'And the stepmother, Maude; how do you and she get on?'
</p>

<p>
'As my letters have told you&mdash;oh, I hate her, as much as
it is in my nature to hate anyone.  When she comes near
me I feel like a cat with its fur rubbed the wrong way.  Can
you not pension her away from Earlshaugh?'
</p>

<p>
'Not if all I hear is true,' replied Roland, giving his dark
moustache an angry twist.  'But who is this fellow Sharpe,
who seems to be her factotum&mdash;and where did she pick
him up?'
</p>

<p>
'He is her brother.'
</p>

<p>
'Her <i>brother</i>!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;so you must be wary&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Till I see MacWadsett?'
</p>

<p>
'If that will make any difference, which I fear not,' replied
Maude, lowering her voice, and actually glancing round
with apprehension, while her blue eyes lighted with
indignation; 'he lives here&mdash;perhaps she told you so?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;lives here&mdash;here in Earlshaugh?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; he has rooms set apart for him in the Beatoun
wing.'
</p>

<p>
'By <i>her</i> orders?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.  She has the whole estate, and you and me too,
completely in her power.  Papa, in his folly, left her,
apparently, everything; but to come to us, I presume, in
time; and now she is entirely influenced and guided by her
brother.  Literally, we seem to be at his mercy,' continued
the girl, with a kind of a shudder, 'and you must play your
cards well to prevent a catastrophe.'
</p>

<p>
'It is intolerable!' exclaimed Roland, in an accent of
rage.
</p>

<p>
'It is beyond my comprehension.'
</p>

<p>
'I wish old MacWadsett were at home.'
</p>

<p>
'He will not be in town for some weeks yet.'
</p>

<p>
Some bitter words escaped Roland, who added:
</p>

<p>
'God, give me patience!  A fracas in the house with
so many guests coming is, of course, to be avoided.'
</p>

<p>
'I hope your return may make some change, Roland;
it has been so dull here.'
</p>

<p>
'Why&mdash;how?'
</p>

<p>
'County people&mdash;the ladies at least&mdash;are shy of visiting,
I feel that, and often long to join Hester at Merlwood.
You may see that the calling cards in the basket are quite
faded and old.'
</p>

<p>
'No visitors!'
</p>

<p>
'Very few, beyond the parish minister and his wife, or the
doctor, when she has some petty illness.  She was a reader,
a worker, and a musician in mamma's time, I understand;
but is a total idler now, and, save to church, rarely leaves
the grounds.'
</p>

<p>
'Her dowry and the Dower House she was entitled to,
but who could ever have dreamed that she, the meek-faced,
humble, and most obsequious Deborah Sharpe would ever
be the mistress of all this!' exclaimed Roland as he strode
to a window and looked forth upon the view with a heart
that thrilled with many mingled emotions, for he loved his
ancestral home with a love that was a species of passion,
especially after his term of foreign exile.
</p>

<p>
Its situation was so perfect, overhanging the fertile haugh
that gave the place a name, and through which meandered
a stream, that, though insignificant there, widened greatly
before it reached the sea.
</p>

<p>
The house of Earlshaugh is large and picturesque.  Built
originally in the days when James III. was King of the
realm, and when that ill-fated monarch granted a special
license to the then Baron to erect a fortalice, 'surrounded
with walls and ditches, defended by gates of brass or iron,'
many additions had been made to it, and the grace of a
venerable antiquity was now combined with the comfort and
luxury of modern days.
</p>

<p>
The old rooms were small, panelled with pine rather than
oak; and the old shot and arrow loopholes under the
windows had long since been plugged up and plastered over.
In the olden time gardens were too valuable to be left
outside the walls of a Scottish fortalice at a feudal neighbour's
mercy, and trees only afforded cover for an attacking foe;
but now the slopes crowned by Earlshaugh sheltered a
modern garden with all its rare flowers, and the clefts of the
rock afforded nurture for numerous trees and shrubs.
</p>

<p>
Royalty had often taken its ease in Earlshaugh, and in its
grounds there is still a venerable thorn-tree in which
tradition says the hawks of the Fifth and Sixth Jameses were
wont to roost; nor was the house unknown in history and
war, for there is still a room that was occupied by Cardinal
Beatoun, the stair to which had a peculiarity after his
murder, that whoever went up its steps felt as if going down;
and the western wall yet bears the marks of the cannon shot,
when it was attacked by General D'Oisel, the Comte de
Martigues, and other French chevaliers, in the wars of Mary
of Guise, and when Kirkcaldy of Grange, by one stroke of
his two-handed sword, slew at its gate the Comte de
St. Pierre, Knight of St Michael.
</p>

<p>
In that old house every chamber had its story of some
past occupant; for there the Lairds of Earlshaugh were
born; there they brought home their brides, and there they
had&mdash;unless they fell in battle&mdash;died and been borne forth
by their own people to Leuchars Kirk, or to the Chapel of
St. Bennet, of which no vestige now remains.
</p>

<p>
Looking over the fair and sunlit scene before him, Roland
Lindsay was thinking of all these things, while Maude
drooped her pretty head on his shoulder, and said:
</p>

<p>
'It is so terrible to suppose that we may have lost all this
through the folly&mdash;the weakness of papa.'
</p>

<p>
'In the hands of an artful Jezebel!  But who is that
person riding straight across the lawn, heedless of path or
avenue?'
</p>

<p>
'Sharpe&mdash;Mr. Hawkey Sharpe,' replied Maude, starting
with something like a shudder again&mdash;an emotion which
Roland fortunately did not perceive; for with reference to
this obnoxious person there was a secret between him and
her which Maude, with all her love and affection, dared not
confide to her fiery brother, lest it should bring about the
very catastrophe which she dreaded so much.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
ROLAND'S VEXATION.
</h3>

<p>
'In my father's house on sufferance only, it would seem!'
was the half-aloud remark muttered through his teeth by
Roland, when betimes next morning he was up while the
dew was glittering on shrub and tree, to have a ramble, cigar
in mouth, and feeling with bitterness in his heart that
through the fault of another, rather than himself, he had been
severely and unjustly dealt with.
</p>

<p>
When Roland joined his regiment an elder brother now
dead, Harry Lindsay of the Scots Guards, had been, like
himself, somewhat extravagant&mdash;Harry particularly so amid
the facilities afforded by London for spending freely and
living fast&mdash;thus between certain bills which the later had
compelled the old gentleman to accept, looking upon him,
as he too often said, 'merely as the family banker,' but more
especially by his betting, racing, and other proclivities peculiar
to 'the Brigade,' he had so enraged the old Laird of
Earlshaugh that, acted upon by the influence of his unwise
'second election,' the latter had executed a will&mdash;the
obnoxious document so often referred to&mdash;completely in her
favour, leaving her everything, with certain arrangements&mdash;a
provision&mdash;for his surviving son Roland and his daughter
Maude.
</p>

<p>
A codicil, tending to reverse or revoke this, had evidently
been in preparation, but was never fulfilled or signed.
</p>

<p>
Thus far alone Roland had been made aware, but was
still inclined to doubt the tenor of a document he had never
seen, which he could not as yet see, and the copy of which,
sent to him in Egypt, had been lost in the transmission as
stated.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, he was a soldier&mdash;nothing but a soldier in many
ways, and, as he was wont to say to himself, 'an utter muff,'
so far as business matters were concerned.
</p>

<p>
Of his own dubious position at Earlshaugh and the
presumption of Mr. Hawkey Sharpe, the steward or manager
of the property, he was soon to have unpleasantly convincing
proofs that sorely tested his patience and tried his proud and
impetuous temper.
</p>

<p>
A prey to somewhat chequered thoughts, he had wandered
in the dewy morning over much of the beautiful and
picturesque property.  Every lane, hedgerow, field, and farm
had been familiar to him from his boyhood, since old Johnnie
Buckle, the head groom, had taught him to take his fences,
even as the old gamekeeper, Gavin Fowler, had shown him
where the best grown coveys were sure to be found.  He
had seen alterations and innovations which displeased him
extremely, and had visited some of the tenants, attended in
his ramble by an old herd who had been in the service of
the Lindsays for half a century; and he now returned by
the great avenue, where still the ancient oaks, that erewhile
had heard the bugle of King James, the Scottish Haroun, on
many a hunting day, still gave forth their leaves from year to
year, and entered the cosy old-fashioned breakfast-room,
where Dresden china and glittering plate, with an array of
cold meats, fish, and fruit, suggested a hearty Scottish
morning repast, and over the carved stone fireplace of which hung
a portrait of his father in the scarlet costume of the
Caledonian Hunt.  Maude was not there; but to his indignation
the room had another occupant.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Trotter, when you have quite ended the perusal of
that paper you will, perhaps, so far favour me?'
</p>

<p>
The person he addressed with a grim but mock suavity
was Tam Trotter, who, clad in the Lindsay livery, blue and
yellow, making certain of not being disturbed, had&mdash;with all
the coolness, if not the easy elegance, of a 'Jeames' of
Belgravia or Mayfair&mdash;seated himself in the breakfast-room,
and, with his slippered feet on a velvet fender stool, and his
broad back reclined in an easy-chair, was deep in the columns
of the <i>Fife Herald</i>.
</p>

<p>
He started up overwhelmed with confusion, and began in
a breathless voice to stammer an apology.
</p>

<p>
'There&mdash;there&mdash;that will do; but don't let this happen
again, Trotter,' said Roland; 'it shows that the discipline
of the house wants adjustment.  By Jove, if I had you in
barracks I'd send you to knapsack-drill for a week!'
</p>

<p>
The wretched Tam made a hasty retreat, and Maude,
detecting the situation, came in laughing merrily to get her
brother's morning kiss, and looking, he thought, so bright,
so sweet, and so pretty.  'Who,' says Anthony Trollope,
'has not seen some such girl when she has come down early,
without the full completeness of her morning toilet, and yet
nicer, fresher, prettier to the eye of him who is so favoured
than she has ever been in more formal attire?'
</p>

<p>
'Covers laid for two only&mdash;thank goodness, you and I
are to have our breakfast <i>tête-à-tête</i>!' she exclaimed, as she
seated herself at the table, and the terribly 'cowed' or
abashed Trotter took post behind her.
</p>

<p>
'And then I must be off to the stables to see what cattle
are there, and renew my acquaintance with old Johnnie
Buckle, who taught me how to take my flying leaps&mdash;never
to funk at a bullfinch, a sunk fence, a mill race, or anything.
Many of Johnnie's tricks stood me in good stead, Maude,
when I was with poor Hicks and Baker in Egypt,' said
Roland.
</p>

<p>
Strolling forth in the bright morning sunshine, amid which
the house of Earlshaugh, with its massive walls of polished
ashlar, its machicolated battlement and tall, old windows,
glittered in light, with masses sunk in shadow, he was
met by the head gardener, old Willie Wardlaw, whom he
remembered as a faithful servitor in years past (and whose
rarest peaches he had stolen many a time and oft), with a
hand outstretched in welcome, and his hat in the other, as
he bowed his silvery head in token of respect.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, sir, but I've been langing to see ye ere it is owre
late and the mischief done!' he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'What mischief?'
</p>

<p>
'The meadowing o' the park and lawn, where never a
plough has been since the King was in Falkland.'
</p>

<p>
'Who has suggested this piece of utilitarian barbarity?'
asked Roland with lowering brow.
</p>

<p>
'Wha wad it be but Mr. Hawkey Sharpe?  Pawkie-Sharpe
wad be a better name for him,' was the contemptuous
response, made with evident bitterness of heart.
</p>

<p>
'I'll see to that, Willie,' said Roland as he strode on, but
soon to be confronted by another official&mdash;a kind of
forester&mdash;who had charge of all the timber on the property.
</p>

<p>
'I hope, Captain,' said the latter, 'you're in time to save
the King's Wood, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'Ye surely ken it is doomed&mdash;a' to the King's Thorn?'
</p>

<p>
'Doomed&mdash;how?'
</p>

<p>
'To be cut down and sold&mdash;a black, burning shame!
Some o' the aiks are auld as the three Trees o' Dysart!'
</p>

<p>
'By whose order?' asked Roland, greatly ruffled.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Mr. Hawkey Sharpe's, of course.'
</p>

<p>
'But why?'
</p>

<p>
'It is no for me to say, sir,' replied the old man uneasily;
'but folk hint that when a body backs the wrong horse at
races some one maun pay the piper.  Maister Sharpe cuts
gey near the wind, and comes aftener wi' the rake than the
shool; but he'll get a bite o' his ain bridle, I hope, yet!'
</p>

<p>
'Racing, is it?  I shall see this matter attended to also.
His presumption is unparalleled!' said Roland, as with
something between a groan and an imprecation on his lips he
passed on, to look after a mount for Annot Drummond, and
to digest this new piece of information&mdash;that the so-called
steward was about to cut down one of the oldest of the
ancestral woods on the property to meet a gambling debt!
</p>

<p>
At the stables, warm indeed was the welcome he met
from the veteran groom Johnnie, who did not seem older
by a day since Roland had seen him last&mdash;hale, hardy, and
lithe, though past his sixtieth year, with long body, short
bandy legs, small, closely-shaven head, and sharp, keen,
twinkling eyes&mdash;his white tie scrupulously folded, and attired
as usual in a heavily flapped corduroy waistcoat, with large
pockets, in one of which was stuck a curry-comb, and in his
hands was a steel bridle-bit, which he was polishing with
leather till it shone like silver.
</p>

<p>
Roland Lindsay had been so long away from among his
own people and native country, that he felt the keenest
pleasure at the warmth of his reception by any of the old
servants whom the new <i>régime</i> permitted to linger about
Earlshaugh.
</p>

<p>
'Eh, Captain, how like the Laird, your worthy father, you
are!' exclaimed old Johnnie Buckle, with kindly eyes,
adding, 'but I hope you'll never live to be sic a
gomeral&mdash;excuse me, sir.'
</p>

<p>
Roland knew to what the old fellow referred, and was
silent.
</p>

<p>
Like the old English squire of Belton, his father had been,
though a popular man with all his friends, and brother
fox-hunters especially, and a boon companion too&mdash;one that
had a dignity that was his from nature rather than effort,
but was 'a man who, in fact, did little or nothing in the
world&mdash;whose life had been very useless, but who had been
gifted with such a presence that he looked as though he
were one of God's noblest creatures.  Though always dignified,
he was ever affable, and the poor liked him better than
they might have done had he passed his time in searching
out their wants and supplying them.'  Though little of
eleemosynary aid is ever required or looked for by the manly,
self-reliant, and independent peasantry of Scotland.
</p>

<p>
'You have some good nags here,' said Roland, as he
walked through the stables.  'I shall want two or three for
the saddle in a day or two.'
</p>

<p>
The old groom shook his head and chewed a straw
viciously.
</p>

<p>
'I should like a spin on this one&mdash;a pretty roan hunter.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; he's about sixteen hands high, a bonnie wee
head, full chest and barrel, broad i' the loins, and firm
of foot.'
</p>

<p>
'The very nag for me, Johnnie.'
</p>

<p>
'But you can't have him, Maister Roland,' said the groom,
forgetting the lapse of years.
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'That is Mr. Hawkey Sharpe's favourite saddle horse.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh&mdash;indeed&mdash;this mare, then?'
</p>

<p>
'That is his hack.'
</p>

<p>
'The devil!  This roadster, then?'
</p>

<p>
'His pad; no leg must cross it but his own.  That is a
nag more difficult to find in perfection than even a hunter or
roan,' said Buckle, passing a hand admiringly over the silky
flank of the animal.  'That bay cob is close on saxteen
hands high, bonnie in shape, as ye see, and high-stepping in
action, gentle as a wean, and a wean might lead it.'
</p>

<p>
'That, too, is Mr. Sharpe's, I presume!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'By Jove, he is well mounted!' said Roland, in irrepressible
wrath, thinking of a certain individual 'on horse-back.'
</p>

<p>
'That pair of thirteen hands each are Miss Lindsay's.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah,' thought Roland, a little mollified, 'one of them
will mount Annot.  Mr. Sharpe dabbles a little in
horse-flesh, I have heard?'
</p>

<p>
'And loses sometimes, Maister Roland.'
</p>

<p>
'How do you know?'
</p>

<p>
'By his face, for then he girns like a sheep's heid in the
smith's tangs.  He kens as little o' dogs, or he wadna gang
aboot wi' a dust-hole pointer at his heels.'
</p>

<p>
'What kind of pointer is that, Buckle?'
</p>

<p>
'A cur o' nae mair breed than himsel',' replied the old
groom, who evidently had no love for the steward.  'Hech,
me!' he added under his breath, as Roland left the stable-yard
with evident disgust and annoyance in his face and air,
'is he yet to learn that a bad servitor never made a gude
maister, and that a sinking maister mak's a rising man?
Dule seems to hang o'er Earlshaugh!'
</p>

<p>
But more mortification awaited Roland.  He knew that
there was an infinity of matters connected with the
tenants&mdash;rents, repairs, timber, oxen, fences, and winter forage,
renewal of leases, and so forth&mdash;on which there was no
appearance of him, the heir, the only son, being consulted;
and of this he soon had unpleasant proof.
</p>

<p>
'Remember what I urged, dearest Roland,' said his sister,
as she joined him at the <i>porte cochère</i> and lifted her loving
and smiling blue eyes to his, while clasping both hands over
his arm and hanging upon him.  'Do keep your temper in
any interview you may have with this man Sharpe, who
actually affects to think it a condescension to accept his
post in our household, as he has been heard to say that
a gentleman must live somehow, as well as other people
do.'
</p>

<p>
'I must see him,' said Roland through his clenched teeth,
as he entered the library, where he found Mr. Hawkey
Sharpe, who was usually installed there at the same hour
daily, on business matters intent, occupying the late Laird's
easy-chair, seated at his table, which was littered with
account-books, letters, and papers, while at his back hung on
the wall a full-length, by Scougal, of that Colonel Lindsay
who figured in the Legend of the Weird Yett, looking grim,
haughty, and proud, as the subjects of most old portraits do,
when every gentleman looked like a great lord.
</p>

<p>
Sharpe saw the black expression that hovered in Roland's
sombre face, and, rising, accorded him a bow, and, in
deference to the presence of Maude (and perhaps of his
sister, who entered the room at the same moment), laid aside
his cigar.
</p>

<p>
'Among some letters to me this morning,' said Roland,
'is one from old Duncan Ged, for a renewal of his lease of
the Mains of Dron.'
</p>

<p>
'But I have no idea of doing so,' replied Mr. Sharpe,
dipping his pen in the ink-bottle.
</p>

<p>
'<i>You?</i>' queried Roland.
</p>

<p>
'I&mdash;I mean, that is&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Who or what the devil do you mean, Mr. Sharpe?' said
Roland, undeterred by the pressure of Maude's little hand
on his arm.
</p>

<p>
'I mean that Mrs. Lindsay, acting on my advice, has no
intention of doing so.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?' asked Roland, dissembling his rage, to find the
mask thrown off thus.
</p>

<p>
'Because the land is worth twice as much again as it was
in the days when your grandfather gave a tack of the Mains
to his grandfather.'
</p>

<p>
'Surely he deserves to benefit thereby?'
</p>

<p>
'We don't think so.'
</p>

<p>
'We again!' thought Roland, trembling with suppressed
passion; but now Trotter, the servant, announced that the
gamekeeper wished to see Mr. Sharpe, and Gavin Fowler
was ushered in&mdash;an old man whose eyes, when Roland
shook hands with him, glistened with pride and pleasure, as
he exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
'Welcome back to your father's rooftree and yer ain
fireside, sir; a' here hae lang wanted ye sairly.'
</p>

<p>
A sneer hovered on the lips of Hawkey Sharpe, as he
said briefly to the keeper, who had a gun under his arm,
a shot-belt over his shoulders, and a couple of dogs at his
heels:
</p>

<p>
'Well, what brings you here to-day?'
</p>

<p>
'I've caught that loon Jamie Spens snaring rabbits and
hares in the King's Wood.'
</p>

<p>
'At last,' said Hawkey Sharpe through his teeth.
</p>

<p>
'At last, sir,' responded the keeper, chiefly to Roland.
</p>

<p>
'Did he show fight?' asked Sharpe.
</p>

<p>
'Of course he did; Jamie comes o' a camstairy and
fechtin' race.'
</p>

<p>
'I know that,' said Roland; 'this is not his first offence,
by what you said?'
</p>

<p>
'Allow <i>me</i>, sir,' said the steward pointedly, with a wave of
his hand.
</p>

<p>
'He is no bad kind o' chield,' urged the keeper.
</p>

<p>
'He will serve for an example, anyway!'
</p>

<p>
'His family are puir&mdash;starving, in fact, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'What the deuce do I care?  I'd as soon shoot a poacher
as a weasel.'
</p>

<p>
'Let the poor fellow off for this time,' said Roland.
</p>

<p>
'Of course&mdash;do, please,' urged Maude; 'if you, Mr. Sharpe,
were poor, hungry, and, more than all, had a hungry
wife and children&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'They are nothing to me.'
</p>

<p>
'But such pretty little children!' urged Maude.
</p>

<p>
'God bless your kind heart, miss!' exclaimed the old
keeper.
</p>

<p>
'Let him go&mdash;this once&mdash;I say,' said Roland, still boiling
at the tone and manner adopted by the steward.
</p>

<p>
'For my sake,' added Maude sweetly.
</p>

<p>
'For yours?' asked Mr. Sharpe, looking at her with a
peculiar expression to which Roland had not yet the key,
for he said firmly and emphatically:
</p>

<p>
'At my <i>order</i>, rather!'
</p>

<p>
'Roland, please don't interfere,' said his cold and
pale-faced stepmother; 'Mr. Sharpe knows precisely how to deal
with these people.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh&mdash;indeed!'
</p>

<p>
'I shall not take my way in this instance,' said Mr. Sharpe
condescendingly; 'and so, to please <i>you</i>, Miss Lindsay, the
culprit shall go free,' he added, with a bow to Maude, who
blushed, more with annoyance, apparently, than satisfaction,
while Roland, in obedience to an imploring glance from her,
stifled his indignation, and abruptly quitted the library.
</p>

<p>
'I thank ye for trying to help me, sir,' said old Duncan
Ged, who stood in the hall, bonnet in hand, and apparently
quite crushed by the non-renewal of his lease; 'but Hawkey
Sharpe is the hardest agent between the Forth an' Tay; he
turns the puir out o' house and hame at a minute's notice,
and counts every hare and rabbit in the woods.  E'en's ye
like, Mr. Sharpe!' said the old man, shaking his clenched
hand in the direction of the library door; 'ilka man buckles
his belt his ain gate, as I maun buckle mine.  Everything
has an end, and a pudding has twa.'
</p>

<p>
And thus strangely consoling himself, he took his
departure.  Roland sent the old man by post a cheque for
fifty pounds; he could do no more at that time.
</p>

<p>
'But for dear Maude's sake,' thought Roland, 'I should
certainly never set foot in Earlshaugh till these matters of
mine are cleared up&mdash;and perhaps never again!  But I'll
make no fracas till after the covert shooting is over and our
guests are gone; <i>then</i>, by Jove; won't I bring Mr. Hawkey
Sharpe and this grim stepmother to book, if I can!'

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
MAUDE'S SECRET.
</h3>

<p>
Roland had got a suitable mount from old Buckle and
gone for 'a spin,' to leave, if possible, his worries and fidgets
behind him, away by Radernie and as far as Carnbee, where
the green hills that culminate in conical Kellie Law look
down on the Firth of Forth and the dark blue German Sea;
while Maude&mdash;after being down at Spens the poacher's
cottage with money and sundry comforts for his starving
wife and children&mdash;full of the subject of Roland's return and
the approaching visit of her <i>fiancé</i>, Jack Elliot, had written a
long, effusive, and young girl-like epistle to the latter, and
was on her way to slip it into the locked letter-bag in the
hall with her own hand.  She had a consciousness that she
was watched, and with it no desire that her correspondence
should be discussed just then, as she had a nervous dread of
Mr. Hawkey Sharpe, who had actually and presumptuously
ventured on more than one occasion to evince some unmistakable
tenderness towards her&mdash;an indiscretion, to say the
least of it, of which she dared give no hint to her fiery
brother; but which was the source of much disquietude to
poor Maude, and of confusion and distress to her, as
regarded the steward's power in the house, and made her
change colour at the mere mention of his name.
</p>

<p>
And now when passing through a long and lonely wainscotted
corridor, the windows of which on one side overlooked
the haugh beneath the house, and which led to the
great staircase, she came suddenly upon the very object of
her dread, Mr. Sharpe, and hastily thrust her letter into the
bosom of her dress.
</p>

<p>
Though her own mistress, with her engagement to Captain
Elliot acknowledged and accepted by her brother, Maude,
from the influence of circumstances, was&mdash;as stated&mdash;actually
afraid lest this daring admirer should discover that she was
writing to Elliot, so much did she dread the power of Sharpe
and his sister, and their capacity for working mischief.
</p>

<p>
Some vague sense, or doubt, of his security in the future,
and of his sister's continued favour to himself, made
Mr. Sharpe thus raise his bold eyes to the daughter of the house,
aware that she was almost unprotected; her maternal uncle,
Sir Harry, was an old and well-nigh helpless man, and her
brother had yet to run the risks of war in that land now
deemed the grave of armies&mdash;the Soudan.
</p>

<p>
Apart from her beauty of mind and person&mdash;not that
Mr. Hawkey Sharpe cared much about the former or was
influenced thereby&mdash;the latter certainly allured him, and the
helplessness referred to encouraged him in his pretensions,
even when he began to suspect that there was another in the
field, though he knew not yet precisely who that other
was.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sharpe's antecedents were not brilliant.  He had
begun life in a solicitor's office in Glasgow, but had learned
more than law elsewhere; book-making, betting, the
race-course, and billiards had brought him in contact with his
betters in rank but equals in mischief and roguery, and from
them he had acquired a certain factitious polish of manner,
which he hoped now to turn to good account.
</p>

<p>
Maude Lindsay knew and believed in that which Roland
struggled against knowing and believing, the precise tenor of
their father's will; and in terror of precipitating matters with
Sharpe and his sister, she had been compelled to temporize
and submit to the more than effusive politeness of the former,
whose bearing, however, she could not mistake.
</p>

<p>
In nothing, as yet, had he gone beyond those&mdash;in him,
somewhat clumsy&mdash;tendernesses of incipient love-making,
which might, or might not, mean anything, though Maude
felt that they meant too much; and she never forgot the
shock, the start, the humiliating conviction that she
experienced when the necessity of regarding him as a lover was
forced by necessity upon her.
</p>

<p>
Her disdain she utterly failed, at first, to conceal; but
Hawkey Sharpe, whose reading had taught him, through the
perusal of many low and exciting love stories, that a girl
might be won in spite of her teeth, was resolved to persevere.
</p>

<p>
'Good-evening, Mr. Sharpe&mdash;what a start you gave me!'
said Maude, essaying to pass him in the narrow corridor;
but he contrived to bar her way.
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me for a moment,' said he submissively enough;
'I wish you would not call me Mr. Sharpe; and oh, more
than all, that you would permit me to&mdash;to call you Maude!'
</p>

<p>
The latter's eyes flashed fire, soft and blue though they
were.  There was no mistaking the tenor of this mode of
address.  Hawkey Sharpe seemed to have opened the
trenches at last, and Maude's first thought was:
</p>

<p>
'Has he been imbibing too much?'
</p>

<p>
'It was for your sake I let off that poacher Spens this
morning,' said he in a slightly reproachful tone.
</p>

<p>
'For the sake of his wife and children, I hope, rather.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, bother his wife and brats! what are they to me
compared with the satisfaction of pleasing you?'
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Sharpe!' said Maude, drawing back a pace, and, in
spite of herself, cresting up her proud little head.
</p>

<p>
'It seems so hard,' said he, affecting an air of humility,
and casting down his eyes for a moment, 'that there should
be such a gulf apparently between us, Miss Lindsay.'
</p>

<p>
'A gulf,' repeated Maude, not precisely knowing what
to say.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;and you deepen it.  If I attempt to speak to you
even as a friend, you recoil from me; and in this huge,
sequestered house, it seems natural that we should at least
be friends.'
</p>

<p>
'If we are enemies, I know it not, Mr. Sharpe,' said
Maude with some hesitation, and then attempting to cover
the latter by a smile, as she knew the necessity&mdash;a knowledge
which distressed and disgusted her&mdash;of temporizing, which
seemed, even if for a moment, a species of treason to Jack
Elliot.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, inclination and calculations as to the
future, made Sharpe admire Maude very much, and perhaps
he was in love with her as much as it was in his nature to be
in love with anyone beyond himself.  Rejected, or even
scorned, he was not a man to break his heart for any woman
in the land, though it might become inspired by hatred and
a longing for revenge.  Yet he was prepared to make 'a bold
stroke for a wife' in Maude's instance.  If refused once he
would try again, and even perhaps a third or a fourth time,
and feel only an emotion of rage on his final rejection&mdash;so
in reality heart was not so much the affair with him.
</p>

<p>
Maude attempted to pass him, but he still barred her way,
and even sought, without success, to capture one of her
hands.
</p>

<p>
'Open confession is good for the soul,' he resumed, in a
blunt and blundering way, 'and avowals come to one's lips
at times, and cannot be restrained.  I have played too long
with fire, or with edged tools.  You must know, Miss
Lindsay, that no man could be in your society much without
admiring you, and admiration is but a prelude to&mdash;love.'
</p>

<p>
Fear of him, and all a quarrel with him might involve, repressed
the girl's desire to laugh at this inflated little speech;
but he&mdash;with all his constitutional impudence&mdash;quailed for a
moment under the expression that flashed in her eyes&mdash;blue,
and usually soft and sunny though they were&mdash;while she
remained silent and thinking:
</p>

<p>
'What on earth will he say next?'
</p>

<p>
'Do you not understand me, Miss Lindsay?' he asked,
perceiving a look of wonder gathering in her face.  'Do you
not know that I love you?' he added, lowering his voice,
while glancing round with quick and stealthy eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Sharpe,' said Maude, trembling, yet rising to the
occasion, 'I understand what you say; but I hope you are
not serious, and not insulting me.'
</p>

<p>
'Is the emotion with which you have inspired me likely to
be mingled with jest, or with insult to you?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, this is too much!' said Maude, interlacing her fingers,
with difficulty restraining tears of anger and resentment,
while, with a keen sense of future danger and his presumption,
she felt as if there was something unreal and grotesque
in the situation.  Moreover, she was anxious to get her letter
into the house postal bag ere the latter was taken away.
</p>

<p>
'I am deeply earnest, Miss Lindsay,' resumed Sharpe,
still with great humility of tone and manner.  'My regard
for you is no passing fancy.  I learned to love you from the
first moment I saw you.'
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Sharpe,' said Maude, gathering courage from desperation,
'I do not understand why you venture to talk in this
style to me!  Encouragement I have never given you, even
by a glance.'
</p>

<p>
'Too well do I know that,' said he, affecting a mournful
tone; 'but I hope to lead you to&mdash;to like me a little in
return.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't dislike you,' said Maude, again seeking to
temporize.
</p>

<p>
'And, if possible, to love me&mdash;as a man&mdash;one to whom
you can entrust a future you cannot see&mdash;one whom you
will one day call husband.'
</p>

<p>
He drew nearer as his voice became lower and more
earnest, and Maude recoiled hastily in growing dismay, and
the words 'a future you cannot see' stung her deeply.
</p>

<p>
Too well did she know that all this bold love-making was
born of the humbled, fallen, and peculiar nature of her
position under her ancestral rooftree, and of the ruin of her
family&mdash;a ruin on which this man was rising under his sister's
wing!
</p>

<p>
'I beseech you, Mr. Sharpe,' said she, 'to say no more
on this subject, for more than the merest friendship there
can never be between us.'
</p>

<p>
'Have you thought it over?'
</p>

<p>
'Certainly not!'
</p>

<p>
His face clouded, and his usually bold, observant, and
keen gray eyes became inflamed with growing anger.
</p>

<p>
'Seriously&mdash;deliberately you refuse to accord me the
slightest hope?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'You think by this bearing to humiliate me as much as a
proud girl can do?'
</p>

<p>
'You pain me now by speaking thus,' she responded more
gently.
</p>

<p>
'And you ruin my life!'
</p>

<p>
'I think not,' said Maude, with a little curl on her lovely
lip.
</p>

<p>
'And may make that ruin a subject of jest to your
brother's fine friends who are coming here in a few
days&mdash;a few hours, rather, now.'
</p>

<p>
At this coarse remark Maude accorded him an inquiring
stare.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, I know what young girls are,' he resumed in a half-savage,
half-sullen manner.  'A rejection like mine is just
the sort of thing they like to boast of.'
</p>

<p>
'You thus add insult to your profound presumption!'
exclaimed Maude, quite exasperated now by the under-breeding
of the style he adopted so suddenly; and, sweeping
past him, she reached the entrance-hall, where the postal
bag lay&mdash;a square and stately place, the stone floor of which
was covered with soft matting; where in winter a great fire
always blazed in the spacious stone fireplace, over which
hung a single suit of armour, amid a trophy of weapons, old
swords, mauls, and pikes.
</p>

<p>
She put her hand in her bosom&mdash;her letter&mdash;the letter
she wished to dispose of with her own hand&mdash;was no longer
there!  How&mdash;where had she dropped it?  She turned,
looked hastily round her, and saw Mr. Hawkey Sharpe,
who had evidently picked it up, descending the staircase,
and he handed it to her with a slight and grave bow.
</p>

<p>
'Oh&mdash;thank you,' said Maude, her mind now full of
confusion and vexation.
</p>

<p>
Quick as thought she dropped it into the postal bag after
he handed it to her, but not before he had seen the address,
and a dangerous gleam shot athwart his shifty eyes, and
again the coarse, bold nature of the man came forth.
</p>

<p>
'So&mdash;so,' said he, through his clenched teeth.  'I find I
have been mistaken in you, Miss Lindsay.'
</p>

<p>
'Mistaken, Mr. Sharpe?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;mistaken all along.'
</p>

<p>
'I do not comprehend you.'
</p>

<p>
'Deceived by your soft, fair face and gentle eyes, I
thought you unlike other girls&mdash;no coquette&mdash;no flirt&mdash;and
now&mdash;now, I find&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What, sir?' demanded Maude impetuously.
</p>

<p>
'That you have correspondents.'
</p>

<p>
'Few, I suppose, are without them.'
</p>

<p>
'But who is he to whom you openly write&mdash;this Captain
John Elliot?'
</p>

<p>
'Intolerable!  How dare you ask me?' demanded Maude,
her breast swelling, her cheeks, not flushed, but pale with
anger, and her eyes flashing.
</p>

<p>
'A military friend of your brother's, I suppose we shall
call him,' said he with an undisguised sneer.
</p>

<p>
'And a dear friend of mine,' said Maude defiantly,
exasperated to find that the very discovery she wished to avoid
had been made, and by this person particularly; 'but here
comes my brother, and perhaps you had better make your
inquiries of him,' she added, as a great sigh of mingled anger
and relief escaped her on hearing Roland dismount under
the <i>porte-cochère</i>; but, unable to face even him, distressed,
humiliated, and altogether unnerved by her recent interview,
all it involved, and all she had undergone, poor little Maude
rushed away to seek alleviation amid a passion of tears,
unseen and in the solitude of her own room.
</p>

<p>
So this was Maude's secret!
</p>

<p>
Hawkey Sharpe cared not just then to face Roland
Lindsay; but with hands clenched he sent a glance of hate
after the retreating figure of Maude, and withdrew in haste.
</p>

<p>
They met in future, as we shall show, even amid Roland's
guests; but with a consciousness&mdash;a most humiliating and
irritating one to Maude, that there was almost a secret
understanding&mdash;that odious love-making between them&mdash;and
known, as she thought, to themselves alone.

CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
MR. HAWKEY SHARPE SEEKS COUNSEL.
</h3>

<p>
We have said that Maude thought that Mr. Hawkey Sharpe's
love-making, with all its euphonious platitudes, was known
to him and to herself alone.
</p>

<p>
In this she was mistaken, as Hawkey's sister Deborah,
Mrs. Lindsay, was in his confidence in that matter, and
quite <i>au fait</i> of its doubtful progress.  She did not appear
at dinner that evening, but dined in her own room, and
then betook her to her brother's sanctum, or 'den,' as he
called it&mdash;a picturesque old panelled apartment, in what
was named the Beatoun wing&mdash;which had a quaint stone
fireplace, the grate of which was full of August flowers then,
but at the hearth of which in the winter of the year before
Pinkeyfield was fought, his Eminence had been wont to toast
his scarlet-slippered toes.
</p>

<p>
The furniture was quite modern.  Fishing and shooting
gear, with whips, spurs, billiard cues, a few soiled books on
farriery and racing, were its chief features now; while
sporting calendars, etc., strewed the table, with a few note and
account books, and letters of minor importance.
</p>

<p>
After gloomily referring to his late interview with Maude
Lindsay, he assisted himself to a briar-root pipe from a nice
arrangement of meerschaums and other pipes stuck in an
oaken and steel mounted horseshoe on the broad mantel-shelf,
and prepared to soothe himself with 'a weed' and the
contents of a remarkably long tumbler&mdash;brandy and soda&mdash;sent
up, per Mr. Trotter, from the pantry of old Funnell,
the butler, for his delectation; while his pale and
sallow-visaged sister was content to sip from a slender glass a
decoction of some medical stuff prescribed for chronic low
spirits and weak action of the heart&mdash;an affliction under
which she laboured, and to which, no doubt, her pallid and
at times stone-coloured complexion was attributable.
</p>

<p>
Always calm in demeanour, she was otherwise unlike
her brother Hawkey, who was not particular to a shade in
anything (provided he was not found out), and she was
outwardly a model of religion and propriety, blended
with hypocrisy, which&mdash;according to Rochefoucauld&mdash;is the
homage that vice pays to virtue.
</p>

<p>
Attired in a luxurious dressing-gown and tasselled smoking
cap, Mr. Sharpe lounged in a cosy easy-chair, shooting
his huge cuffs forward from time to time, and stroking his
sandy, ragged moustache, in what he thought to be 'good
style.'
</p>

<p>
Instead of being thick and podgy, as his humble origin
might suggest, his hands, we must admit, were rather thin,
with long spiky filbert nails, reminding one&mdash;with all their
cultivated whiteness&mdash;of the talons of a bird of prey.
</p>

<p>
'Deuced good thing for us, Deb, that codicil was never
completed,' said he (for about the hundredth time),
breaking a pause; 'but still we have now that fellow, Roland
Lindsay, back again, ready to overhaul matters, after
escaping Arab bullets and swords, desert fever, and the devil
only knows what more.'
</p>

<p>
'You forget that this is his home,' said she, with a little
touch of womanly feeling for the moment, 'or he deems it
as such.'
</p>

<p>
'So long as you permit it, I suppose.'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot throw down the glove to the County just now.'
</p>

<p>
'But assume a virtue if you have it not,' said Hawkey,
applying himself to the long tumbler, that still sparkled and
effervesced in the lamp-light.
</p>

<p>
'He cannot harm me, at all events.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't know that, and I was deuced easier when he
was away in Egypt.  Some might call this selfish&mdash;what
the devil do I care!  A man's chief duty centres on himself.'
</p>

<p>
'Without pity for the unfortunate?'
</p>

<p>
'Don't be a humbug, Deb, and don't act to me!  The
poor and unfortunate are so, by their own fault, I suppose.
I wish to speak with you about that to which I
have&mdash;reluctantly&mdash;referred more than once.'
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Lindsay made a gesture of impatience, and said,
while toying with her pet cur Fifine:
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;money matters with reference to yourself in the
future?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; but I do dislike, my dear Deb,' said he, with an
affection which she knew right well was mostly simulated,
'discussing them with you.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'It is so disagreeable.'
</p>

<p>
'It would be more disagreeable for you if there were no
money matters to discuss,' she replied with the smallest
approach to a sneer.  'But, to the point, Hawkey&mdash;I know
what it is!'
</p>

<p>
'You are not strong, you know, dear Deb; you may go
off&mdash;' (the hooks, he was about to say, but changed his
mind)&mdash;'off suddenly, and not leave your house well ordered.  We
should always be prepared for the worst.  You know what
the best doctors in Edinburgh have told you,' he added,
burying his nose and moustache in the tumbler again.
</p>

<p>
'Well?' said she.
</p>

<p>
'I mean that you should execute that will you spoke of.'
</p>

<p>
'In your favour?'
</p>

<p>
'And so preclude all contention from any quarter&mdash;a
hundred times I have hinted this to you.'
</p>

<p>
'How kind and soothing the reminder is!' she replied
bitterly, unwilling, like all selfish people, to adopt or face
the dire idea of death, sudden or otherwise.
</p>

<p>
'I do advise you to consider well, Deb.'
</p>

<p>
'For your sake, of course.'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;it may seem selfish, dear Deb.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;advice is a commodity which every possessor deems
most valuable, and yet hastens to get rid of.'
</p>

<p>
Hawkey eyed her anxiously, for her irritation and
animosity, when her delicate health and disease of the heart
were referred to, always predominated over every other
feeling, but she waived them for the time and returned to the
first subject.
</p>

<p>
'So that was all your success with Maude?'
</p>

<p>
'Not much, certainly,' he replied, with a scowl at
vacancy.
</p>

<p>
'Unfortunate!'
</p>

<p>
'Rather!'
</p>

<p>
'As the provision left by her father is a most ample one
for her.'
</p>

<p>
'Not so ample as all Earlshaugh, however,' thought he,
refilling his briar-root in silence.
</p>

<p>
'You must persevere.  It has been truly said that "the
days of Jacob are over, that men don't understand waiting
now, and it is always as well to catch your fish when you
can."'
</p>

<p>
Hawkey smoked on in silence.  He had never before
dared to lift his eyes so high, never before ventured to
'make love' to a lady.  His past experience had been more
sudden, abrupt, less bothersome, and more acceptable.
Had he done or said too much, or too little?  Ought he to
have gone down on his knees like the lovers he had seen on
the stage, or read of in old story books?
</p>

<p>
No&mdash;he was certain she would have laughed at him had
he done so; and he was also certain no one 'did that sort
of thing' nowadays.  The age of such supplication was
assuredly past; and he thought, viciously too, that he had
'done all that may become a man.'
</p>

<p>
'These bloated aristocrats, Deb, have a way all their own,
of setting a fellow down!' said he, with a louring expression
in his shifty, pale-gray eyes; 'she is, I know, my superior in
position, in the way the world goes, <i>as yet</i>,' he continued,
for Mr. Hawkey Sharpe, though longing for the vineyard of
Naboth, was&mdash;at heart&mdash;a Social-Democrat; 'my superior
in birth, education, and habits.'
</p>

<p>
'I should think so.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't sneer at me, Deb.'
</p>

<p>
'So far, perhaps, as Maude is concerned, your success
depends, Hawkey, upon whether there is anyone else in her
thoughts.'
</p>

<p>
'Before me, you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;she may be engaged for all we know.  I, for one,
am certainly not in her confidence.  She has a lover,
however, I suspect.'
</p>

<p>
'It looks deuced like the case.  I saw her post a letter to
a fellow named Elliot to-night,' he added, with a knit in his
brow and an ugly gleam in his pale eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Elliot&mdash;that is the name of one of those who come here
to shoot, for the First.'
</p>

<p>
'To shoot?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;on Roland's invitation.'
</p>

<p>
'There may be something else shot than partridges.'
</p>

<p>
'Elliot&mdash;Captain Elliot?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;that was the name on her letter.'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;you must not quarrel with him&mdash;that would be
unseemly.'
</p>

<p>
'My dear Deb, I never <i>quarrel</i> with those I <i>hate</i>,'  was the
comprehensive and sinister reply of Hawkey Sharpe, with
his most diabolical expression; 'and though I have never
seen this interloper Elliot, I feel a most ungodly hatred of
him already.'
</p>

<p>
'I repeat that no good can come of a vulgar quarrel, and
that you must not forget the proprieties.  What would the
servants alone say or think?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, d&mdash;n the servants!' responded her brother, tugging
his moustache angrily; 'but if that fellow Elliot is her
lover, I must put my brains in steep and contrive to separate
them at all hazards, Deb.  If I allow him or anyone else to
enter the stakes, I shall be out of the running.  Anyhow, as
you are looking pale, Deb, I mustn't keep you here talking
over my incipient love affairs, or you will not be able to
receive some of these infernal guests, who, I believe, come
to-morrow.  You are not overburdened with visitors, however.'
</p>

<p>
'Yet I would rather it was the time of their going than
their coming,' said Mrs. Lindsay, whom his remark touched
on a tender point.
</p>

<p>
'Why?' asked Hawkey.
</p>

<p>
'They must soon perceive that I am tabooed by the
county families&mdash;that no one calls here as of old.'
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'Except, perhaps, the people from the Manse and the
doctor.'
</p>

<p>
'Neither&mdash;or none&mdash;of whom I care to see.'
</p>

<p>
'And yet I subscribe to all local charities, bazaars, school
feasts, as regularly&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'As if you were an Elder of the Kirk&mdash;thereby wasting
your money to win a place among the "unco guid," and all
to no purpose,' said Hawkey, with the slightest approach to
derision.  'Well&mdash;well; how I shall succeed with the fair
Maude&mdash;if I succeed at all&mdash;time and a little management,
in more ways than one, will show,' he added with knitted
brows and hands clenched by thoughts that were full of
vague but savage intentions.
</p>

<p>
'You know the proverb,' said Mrs. Lindsay, with a cold
smile, as she lifted up her dog and retired: 'a man may
woo as he will, but maun wed where his weird is.'
</p>

<p>
Hawkey Sharpe set his teeth, and his eyes gleamed as he
thought with&mdash;but did not quote&mdash;Georges Ohnet, because
he knew him not: 'Money is the password of these venal
and avaricious times.  Beauty, virtue, and intelligence
count for nothing.  People no longer say, "Room for the
worthiest," but "Room for the wealthiest!"'
</p>

<p>
Then other things occurred to him.
</p>

<p>
'I am certain that Maude' (he spoke of her as 'Maude'
to himself and his sister) 'won't mention our little matter,
for cogent reasons, to her brother,' he reflected confidently;.
'but I must work the oracle with Deb about her will.  With
that heart ailment which she undoubtedly has, she may go
off the hooks at any moment, as I, perhaps unwisely, hinted;
and I am not lawyer enough to know how old Earlshaugh's
last testament may stand; yet, surely, I am Deb's
heir-at-law, anyhow, I should think!'
</p>

<p>
Unless Mr. Hawkey Sharpe had indulged&mdash;which was not
improbable&mdash;in 'tall talk,' his language and disposition
augured ill for the safety and comfort of Maude's <i>fiancé</i> if he
came to Earlshaugh; but Sharpe's threatened vengeance
had no decided plan as yet.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
'FOOL'S PARADISE.'
</h3>

<p>
The earliest of the guests so roughly referred to by
Mr. Hawkey Sharpe, as stated in the preceding chapter, duly
arrived in the noon of the following day, and were closely
reconnoitred by that personage through a field-glass from an
angle of the bartizan, and he was enabled to perceive that
there were only two young ladies&mdash;a tall, dark-haired one,
and another less in stature, very <i>petite</i> indeed, with a small,
flower-like face and golden hair; for they were simply the
somewhat reluctant Hester Maule and the irrepressible
Annot Drummond, for whose accommodation Mrs. Drugget,
the housekeeper, had made all the necessary preparations.
</p>

<p>
'Welcome to Earlshaugh&mdash;you are no stranger here,
Hester!' said Roland, as he kissed the latter when he
assisted her to alight from the carriage at the <i>porte-cochère</i>&mdash;the
lightest and fleetest thing possible in the way of a
salute&mdash;one without warmth or lingering force; but then
Annot&mdash;whom he did not kiss at all 'before folk'&mdash;had her
hazel-green eyes upon them.
</p>

<p>
For Annot he had the most choice little bouquet that old
Willie Wardlaw, the gardener, could prepare; but there was
none for Hester, an omission which the latter scarcely
noticed.
</p>

<p>
'And this is your home!' exclaimed Annot, burying her
little nose among the many lilies of the valley, pink rosebuds,
and fragrant stephanotis.
</p>

<p>
'It is the home of my forefathers,' replied Roland almost
evasively, as he gave her his arm.
</p>

<p>
'What a romantic reply&mdash;savours quite of a three-volume
novel!' exclaimed Annot, unaware of what the answer too
literally implied, and what was actually passing in Roland's
mind; but Hester felt for him, and saw the painful blush
that crossed his nut-brown cheek.
</p>

<p>
The family legal agent had not yet returned to Edinburgh,
so Roland had not been able to see or take counsel with
him as to what transpired when he was lurking in the desert
after Kashgate.
</p>

<p>
But Annot was come, and for the time he was content to
live at Earlshaugh in that species of Fool's Paradise&mdash;'to
few unknown,' as Milton has it.  As yet nothing more had
been heard of the meadowing of the park or cutting down
the King's Wood; and save that Mr. Hawkey Sharpe from
time to time crossed his path, and even&mdash;to Maude's
intense annoyance, and that of Roland from other causes&mdash;joined
his sister at the family meals, Roland had no other
specific grievance; but he felt as if upon a volcano.
</p>

<p>
As Annot left the carriage, she was greeted warmly and
kindly by Maude, who was glad to return attentions received
in London, and who as yet knew nothing of how the young
lady was situated with regard to Roland, who now looked
round for Mrs. Lindsay as the lady of the house.
</p>

<p>
But the latter, under the <i>régime</i> of her predecessor, his
mother, 'was too accurately acquainted with the weights and
measures of society for such a movement as that;' and thus
received her two guests&mdash;or Maude's rather&mdash;in the Red
Drawing-room, accurately attired in rich black moire, with
lace lappets and jet ornaments; and was, of course,
'delighted' to see both, while according to each, not her hand,
but a finger thereof; and Hester, who knew her well of old,
read again in her pale face that mixture of hardness and
cunning with which the slight smile on her thin lips&mdash;a smile
that never reached her sharp gray eyes&mdash;well accorded.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were handsome, and had been pleasing in their
expression once; but now her somewhat false position in
Earlshaugh and her secret ailment had imparted to them a
defiant, restless, and peculiar one.
</p>

<p>
The coldness of her manner struck Hester as unpleasant;
Roland's politeness was not warmth that made up for it, and
the girl already began to think&mdash;'I was a fool&mdash;a weak fool
to come!  But how to get away, now that I am here?'
</p>

<p>
'It is a beautiful place!' thought the artful and ambitious
little Annot, when left for a few minutes in the solitude of
her own room, and, forgetting even to glance at her soft face
and <i>petite</i> figure in the tall cheval glass or toilette mirror,
gazed dreamily from the windows, arched and deep in the
massive wall, over the far extent of pastoral country, tufted
here and there with dark green woods, with a glimpse of the
German Sea in the distance; and she felt, for a time, all the
anticipative joy of being the mistress&mdash;the joint owner&mdash;of
such a stately old pile as Earlshaugh with all its surroundings,
the historic interest of which was to her, however, a
sealed book; but there is much in the glory of a sense of
ownership, says a writer&mdash;'of the ownership of land and
houses, of beeves and woolly flocks, of wide fields and thick
growing woods, even when that ownership is of late date,
when it conveys to the owner nothing but the realization of
a property on the soil; but there is much more in it when it
contains the memories of old years; when the glory is the
glory of a race as well as the glory of power and property.'
</p>

<p>
And though to a little town-bred bird like Annot such
historic flights were empty things, the old walls of Earlshaugh
had seen ancestors of Roland ride forth heading their
followers with morion, jack, and spear, to the fields of
Flodden, Pinkey, and Dunbar; to the muster place of the
Fife lairds, in the year of Sherriffmuir, and to many a stirring
broil in the days when the Scotsman's sword was always in
his hand and never in its scabbard; but from such
daydreams as did occur to her, Annot was now roused by the
welcome sound of the luncheon gong echoing from the
entrance-hall, and, dispensing with the assistance of a maid,
she hurried at once downstairs.
</p>

<p>
In expectation of the gentlemen who were coming after
the birds on the First, a day or two passed off delightfully
enough, amid the novelty of Earlshaugh, and the evenings
were devoted to music; and despite the unwelcome presence
of the cold, haughty, and somewhat repellant Mrs. Lindsay,
Annot, as at Merlwood, talked to Roland, played for, sang
to Roland, and put forth&mdash;more effusively than ever&mdash;all
her little arts in the way of attraction for him, and him
alone; which his sister Maude, to whom this style of thing
was rather new, looked on with amused surprise at first, and
then somewhat reprehensively and gloomily.
</p>

<p>
To Hester, Roland, acting as host, was elaborate in his
brotherly kindness and attention; perhaps&mdash;nay doubtless&mdash;a
lingering sentiment of remorse had made him so; and she
received it all, but with secret pain and intense mortification,
and Maude's soft blue eyes were not slow to detect this.
</p>

<p>
'Hester,' said Maude, with arms affectionately twined
round her, 'I used to think that you and Roland were very
fond of each other!'
</p>

<p>
'So we were,' said Hester in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
'Were?'
</p>

<p>
'Are, I mean&mdash;very fond of each other.  Why should we
be otherwise?' stammered poor Hester, turning away for a
moment.
</p>

<p>
'I mean&mdash;I thought (uncle Harry used to quiz you both
so much!) he cared for you, and you for him
more&mdash;more&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Than cousins usually do?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no&mdash;no&mdash;you mistake, dear Maude.'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;it seems Annot now; and yet I hope&mdash;ah,
no&mdash;it cannot be.'
</p>

<p>
One fact soon became too apparent to Roland Lindsay:
that his sister Maude did not like Annot Drummond now,
if she ever did.
</p>

<p>
'I never saw a girl so changed since we were at school
together at Madame Raffineur's in Belgium&mdash;even since I
saw her last in London!' said Maude; 'why, Roland, she
has become quite an artful little woman of the world!'
</p>

<p>
'Artful&mdash;oh, Maude!' he expostulated.
</p>

<p>
'Girls in their confidential moods say and admit many
things their best friends know nothing of; but don't let me
vex you, dear Roland.  However, I don't like to hear Annot
boast of enjoying cigarettes and being a good shot.'
</p>

<p>
'All talk, Maude; she takes a waggish delight in startling
you country folks.  I'd stake a round sum on it, she never
tried either,' he replied, with undisguised irritation.
</p>

<p>
Maude was silent for a moment; but she would have been
more than blind had she not seen how Annot and her
brother were affected to each other, and she disliked it.
</p>

<p>
'You love Annot then?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'I do.'
</p>

<p>
'And mean to&mdash;to marry her?'
</p>

<p>
'I hope so.'
</p>

<p>
'With Annot you have not a sentiment in common; and
marriage between two persons whose tastes are diverse is a
great error.'
</p>

<p>
'If our tastes are so; but surely we know our own minds,
little one, quite as much as you and Jack Elliot of ours do.'
</p>

<p>
'There now&mdash;you are angry with me!' said Maude, with
a pout on her lip.
</p>

<p>
'Angry&mdash;not at all, Maude; who could be angry with
you?  But I am disappointed a little.'
</p>

<p>
'And so am I&mdash;not a little, but very much.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'I always thought you were attached to our sweet and
earnest-eyed Hester.'
</p>

<p>
'And so I am,' replied Roland, selecting a cigar with
great apparent care; 'but, as a cousin, you know.'
</p>

<p>
'And now it seems to be Annot!' said Maude, with her
white hands folded on her knee and looking up at him with
an air of annoyance.
</p>

<p>
'Beyond my admissions just made, what led you to think so?'
</p>

<p>
'A thousand things!  I am not blind, nor is anyone
else.  According to what you have said, then you must be
engaged!'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;yes.'
</p>

<p>
'And you keep it a secret?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'But why?'
</p>

<p>
'Surely, Maude, that should be obvious to you.  Till I
can see old Mr. MacWadsett and have certain matters
cleared up.'
</p>

<p>
'You are wise.  But Annot, does she, too, wish the
engagement kept secret?'
</p>

<p>
'Decidedly, from the world at least,'
</p>

<p>
'A comprehensive word; but why?'
</p>

<p>
'I have a little tour in Egypt before me yet.'
</p>

<p>
'My poor Roland!  But to me it seems that when a
couple are engaged there is no reason why all the world
need not know of it, unless there are impediments.'
</p>

<p>
'Which certainly exist so far in our case.  I am the heir
of Earlshaugh, yet is Earlshaugh mine?  At the present
moment,' he added, with his teeth almost set in anger,
'congratulations might be embarrassing.'
</p>

<p>
Maude sighed for her brother's future, but not for her own.
That seemed assured.  She thought that if the fashion of
congratulations prevented promises of marriage being lightly
given, they served a purpose that was good.  She had read
that a girl might say yes 'when asked to marry, with the
mental reservation that if anything better came along she
will continue not to keep her word and think twice about it
if she has to go through such a form' (and such a girl she
shrewdly suspected Annot to be).  Maude also thought that
marriage engagements are frequently too lightly entered into
and too lightly set aside, and that the contract should be as
sacred as marriage itself.
</p>

<p>
'You surely know Annot well?' said Roland, breaking
a silence that embarrassed him.
</p>

<p>
'Oh yes,' replied Maude, without looking up.
</p>

<p>
'I think you will learn to like, nay, must like her!' he
urged.
</p>

<p>
'I shall try, Roland,' was the dubious response, with
which he was obliged to content himself as with other things
in his then Fool's Paradise.

<p>
For two or three days before the all-important First of
September, Roland, the old gamekeeper, Gavin Fowler,
young Malcolm Skene, and even the pardoned poacher
Jamie Spens, had all been busy in a vivid and anxious spirit
of anticipation as the day approached.  Many a time had
they reconnoitered by the King's Wood, the Mains of Dron,
in the Fairy Den, and elsewhere, till they knew every rood
of ground&mdash;ground over which Roland's father had last
rambled on his old shooting pony&mdash;by stubble field,
hedgerow, and scroggy upland slope, where the coveys of the
neighbourhood lay, and knew almost the number of birds
in every covey; and many a time and oft the route of the
first day was planned, schemed out, and enjoyed in imagination;
while the dogs were carefully seen to in their kennels,
and the guns and ammunition inspected in the gunroom,
as if a day of battle were at hand.
</p>

<p>
Yet, even in the Lowlands of Scotland, the palmy days of
shooting are gone in many places never to return.  Muirland
after muirland has been enclosed, marshes reclaimed, and in
other parts the hill slopes, that were lonely, stern, and
wild&mdash;often all but inaccessible&mdash;have now become the sites of
villas, mansions, and new-made railway villages, till people
sometimes may wonder what Cowper meant in his 'Task'
when he wrote&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'God made the country, and man made the town!'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
But much of this applies more to England than to the sister
kingdom.
</p>

<p>
The last evening of August saw a gay dinner party in the
stately old dining-hall of Earlshaugh, with Roland acting as
host, and Mrs. Lindsay, pale and composed as usual, but
brilliant in his mother's suite of diamonds (heir-looms of
the line), too brilliant, he thought, for the occasion, at the
head of the table.
</p>

<p>
Among other friends who had come for the morrow's
shooting were Jack Elliot and Malcolm Skene, both most
prepossessing-looking young fellows; and the style and
bearing of both&mdash;but especially of the former, who had about him
that finishing touch which the service, foreign travel, and
good society impart&mdash;inspired the heart of Mr. Hawkey
Sharpe with much jealous rancour and envy, and with
something of mortification too.
</p>

<p>
It may be superfluous to say that in all the elements that
make a perfect gentleman, and one accustomed to the world,
he far outshone the unfortunate Hawkey; and as he sat
there, clad in evening costume, toying with his wine-glass,
and conversing in a pleasantly modulated voice with Annot
Drummond, who affected to be deeply interested in Cairo
and Alexandria, Tel-el-Kebir and Kassassin, he had no more
consciousness or idea of finding a rival in such a person
than in old Gavin Fowler, the keeper, or Funnell, the butler,
who officiated behind his chair.
</p>

<p>
But Deborah&mdash;Mrs. Lindsay&mdash;was observing Elliot, and
thought of her brother's jealousy, his ambition and avarice,
and his recent threats with secret dread and misgivings,
and, knowing of what he was capable, she glanced at him
uneasily from time to time as he sat silent, almost sullen,
and imbibing more wine than was quite good for him.
</p>

<p>
The appurtenances of the table, especially so far as plate
went, were all that might be expected in a house of such a
style and age as Earlshaugh, and the great chandelier that
hung in the dome-shaped roof with its profusely parqueted
ceiling, shed a soft light over all&mdash;on many a stately but dim
portrait on the walls&mdash;among others, one of the Lindsay of
the Weird Yett, above the stone mantelpiece, on which
was carved the <i>fesse-chequy</i> of Lindsay, crested by a tent,
with stars overhead, and the motto, <i>Astra castra, numen
lumen</i>.
</p>

<p>
In the centre of the board towered a giant silver épergne
(the gift of the Hunt to the late laird) laden with fruit and
flowers, a tableau representing the gallant King James V.,
the 'Commons King,' slaying a stag at bay in Falkland
Wood.
</p>

<p>
Several attractive girls were present, but none perhaps
were more so in their different degree than Maude, with her
sunny hair and winning blue eyes; Hester, with her pure
complexion, soft bearing, and rich dark-brown braids; and
Annot, with her flower-like face, childish playfulness of
manner, and glorious wealth of shining golden tresses.
</p>

<p>
Nearly all at the table were young, and the dinner was a
happy and joyous one, save perhaps to Mr. Hawkey Sharpe,
who felt himself, with all his profound assurance, somewhat
<i>de trop</i>, though he deemed himself, as he was, certainly 'got
up as well as any fellow there.'
</p>

<p>
He was as vain of the form and whiteness of his hands as
ever Lord Byron was, and he was wont to hold forth his
right one, clenching a cambric handkerchief, with a brilliant
sparkling ring of unusual size.  His tie was faultless, his
eyeglass arrogant and offensive, especially to Elliot, after a
time; his would-be general air of stiffness and languid
exclusiveness (imitated ill from others) sat as grotesquely on
him as his habit of leaving remarks unanswered, while to all
appearance critically examining the condition of his spiky
finger-nails.
</p>

<p>
His presence on this particular occasion, though under
the auspices of his sister, at first roused Roland's anger
to fever heat, and the latter took his seat at table with a
very black expression in his handsome face indeed; but he
saw or felt the necessity for dissembling, and ignored his
existence.  Then after a time, affected by the geniality of
his surroundings, by the bright, pleasant faces of his friends,
the conversation, and the circulation of Mr. Funnell's good
wines&mdash;more than all, by the presence of such a sunny little
creature as Annot, who had been consigned to the care of
Jack Elliot&mdash;he completely thawed, and acted the host to
perfection.
</p>

<p>
At his back stood old Funnell, his rubicund visage shining
like a harvest moon, radiant to see Roland in his father's
chair and place at the foot of the table, even though she,
Mrs. Lindsay (<i>née</i> Deborah Sharpe), was at the head thereof,
though 'not Falkland bred,' an old and unforgotten Fife
saying of the days of the princely James's which conveys
much there with reference to birth and breeding.
</p>

<p>
So Roland tried to forget&mdash;perhaps for the time actually
forgot&mdash;the probable or inevitable future, and strove to be
genial with her, though it was quite beyond him to be so
with her cub of a brother; and, indeed, he never stooped to
address him at all.
</p>

<p>
From the opposite side of the table Elliot silently enjoyed
the luxury of admiring his merry-eyed and bright-haired
Maude, and all the natural grace of her actions; but
Hawkey Sharpe was seated directly opposite to her too; yet
her manner betrayed&mdash;even to his keen and observant
eyes&mdash;none of the annoyance or constant confusion which might
have shown itself as regarded <i>him</i> and a recent episode, as
she entirely ignored his existence, while the presence of Jack
shed an ægis over her.
</p>

<p>
After the ladies withdrew, in obedience to a silent sign
from Mrs. Lindsay, the conversation of the gentlemen, as
they closed up towards Roland's chair, developed some
unpleasant features; for Hawkey Sharpe, whose tongue was
loosened and his constitutional impudence encouraged by
Funnell's excellent Pomery-greno, evinced an unpleasant
disposition to cavil at and contradict whatever Elliot
advanced or mentioned&mdash;rather a risky proceeding on the
part of Mr. Sharpe, as Elliot was what has been described
as a 'stand-offish sort of man, with whom one would not
care to joke on an early acquaintance, or slap on the back
and call 'old fellow,' or abbreviate his Christian name;' so,
when the different breeds of sporting dogs and new fire-arms
were under discussion, the steward said abruptly:
</p>

<p>
'Guns&mdash;oh, talking of guns, there is nothing I know
for sport like that with the new grip action, with Schultze
powder.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! you mean,' said Elliot, 'the one with the only
action that works independently of the top lever spring.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'But not for partridges or pheasants.'
</p>

<p>
'For anything,' said Sharpe curtly.
</p>

<p>
'Come, you are mistaken,' replied Jack.
</p>

<p>
'Not at all,' said Sharpe doggedly.
</p>

<p>
'Excuse me,' said the young officer; 'as a sportsman and
an ex-instructor in musketry, you may permit me to have
some knowledge of fire-arms; but the one you refer to is for
big game, and will neither stick nor jam like the Government
rubbish issued to us in Egypt, and is based on the
non-fouling principle.'
</p>

<p>
'Non-fowling?  It will shoot any fowl you aim at,' replied
Sharpe, mistaking his meaning; 'but you don't know what
you are talking about.'
</p>

<p>
Elliot simply raised his eyebrows and stared at the speaker
for a moment.
</p>

<p>
'You heard me?' added Sharpe, with an angry gleam in
his eye.
</p>

<p>
Elliot turned to Skene and spoke of something else; but
his cool and steady, yet inoffensive, stare, and his ignoring
the last defiant remark, exasperated Hawkey Sharpe, who
had&mdash;we have said&mdash;imbibed more wine than he was wont;
and, like all men of his class, particularly felt the quiet
contempt implied by the other's silence and utter indifference to
his presence&mdash;a spirit of defiance very humiliating and
difficult to grapple with, especially by the underbred; thus,
'while nursing his wrath to keep it warm,' Sharpe was
determined to pursue a system of aggravation, and when
Elliot remarked to Roland, in pursuance of some general
observations, that shooting, even in the matter of
black-game and muirgame, should never begin till October, as
thousands of young partridges that are not fair game would
escape being shot by gentlemen-poachers, or falling a prey
when in the hedges and hassocks to the mere pot-hunter&mdash;Hawkey
Sharpe contradicted him bluntly, without knowing
what to urge on the contrary, and made some blundering
statements about following young game into the standing
corn, and how jolly it was to pot even young pheasants in
the standing barley during the month of September.
</p>

<p>
'In these little matters, my good man, you are rather at
variance with Colonel Hawker.'
</p>

<p>
'Who the devil is Hawker?' said Sharpe.
</p>

<p>
'A great authority on all such matters, sir,' said young
Skene, 'and not to have heard of him argues that you
are&mdash;well, imperfectly up in the subject.'
</p>

<p>
'Which we had better drop,' said Roland, with a dangerous
sparkle in his dark eyes; 'but pass the decanters,
Jack&mdash;they stand with you.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hawkey Sharpe gave an audible sniff of contempt,
meant, doubtless, for Elliot, whose cool stare at him was
now blended with a smile indicative of curiosity and
amusement, that proved alike enraging and baffling.
</p>

<p>
When the gentlemen rose to join the ladies in the
drawing-room, whence came the distant notes of the piano and
the voice of Annot Drummond with her inevitable '<i>Du du</i>,'
Hawkey Sharpe, with an unpleasant consciousness that he
had been somewhat foolish and had the worst of his
arguments, withdrew to his sanctum in the Beatoun wing to
growl and smoke over his brandy and soda, and was seen no
more for that night.
</p>

<p>
Pausing in the entrance-hall, Elliot said:
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me, Roland, but who is that unmitigated cad who
contradicted me so at table?&mdash;seemed to want to fix a
quarrel, by Jove!'
</p>

<p>
Roland coloured.
</p>

<p>
'Why, you redden as if he was a bailiff in disguise&mdash;a
man in possession!' said Elliot, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'You forget, Jack, that such officials are unknown on this
side of the Border.'
</p>

<p>
'Then who or what is he?' persisted Elliot.
</p>

<p>
'My overseer&mdash;steward.'
</p>

<p>
'Steward&mdash;the devil! and you have a fellow of that kind
at table.'
</p>

<p>
'Mrs. Lindsay has&mdash;not I,' replied Roland, with growing
confusion and annoyance.  'There are wheels within wheels
here at Earlshaugh, Jack&mdash;a little time and you shall know
all, even before the pheasants you disputed about are ready
for potting.'
</p>

<p>
But before that period came, or the opportunity so lightly
referred to, much was to happen at Earlshaugh that none
could at all foresee.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
'MY LOVE SHE'S BUT A LASSIE YET.'
</h3>

<p>
The First of September came in all that could be wished for
the shooting, in which, to Roland's disgust and Elliot's
surprise, Hawkey Sharpe took a part, but attired in accurate
sporting costume, and duly armed with an excellent
breech-loader.  The corn was yellow in some places, the stubble
bare in others; there were rich 'bits' of colour in every
field, and silver clouds floating in the blue expanse overhead.
In such light, says a writer with an artistic eye, 'the
white horses seem cut out of silver, the chestnuts of ruddy-gold;
while the black horses stand out against the sky as if
cut in black marble; and what gaps half a dozen reapers
soon make in the standing corn!'
</p>

<p>
Then the trails of the ground convolvulus and cyanus
or corn-flower, of every hue, may be seen, while the little
gleaners are afield, tolerated by a good-hearted farmer, who,
like Boaz of old, may, perhaps, permit the poor to glean
'even amongst the sheaves.'  Elsewhere the fern and
heather-covered muirlands were beautiful, with their tiny bushes
laden with wild fruits, bramble, and sloe.
</p>

<p>
How the shooting progressed there&mdash;how coveys were
flushed and surrounded; how the brown birds rose whirring
up, and the <i>cheepers</i> tumbled over in quick succession or
were caught by the dogs; how the latter found the birds
lurking among turnips or potatoes, or where the uncut corn
waved (for there they shelter, engender, and breed), till they
rose in coveys of twenty and even thirty&mdash;may not interest
the reader, so now we must hasten on to other points in our
story, having more important matters to relate; but, as
Mr. Hawkey Sharpe had an unpleasant reputation for shooting
sometimes a little wildly, and forgetting the line of fire,
all&mdash;by the whispered advice of old Fowler, the keeper&mdash;gave
him a very wide berth in the field, and of this he was angrily
conscious.
</p>

<p>
Yet he brought upon himself the irate animadversions of
most of the sportsmen, and more particularly of Jack Elliot,
by ill-using one of the best pointers on the ground.  Trained
by old Gavin Fowler, this animal would not only stand at
the scent of a bird or a hare, but, if in company, would
instantly <i>back</i> if he saw another dog point.  This perfection,
the propensity to stand at the scent of game, though a striking
example of intelligence and docility, was so misunderstood
by Hawkey Sharpe that he dealt poor Ponto a blow
with the butt-end of his rifle, eliciting an oath from the
white-haired keeper, and anger from all&mdash;remarks which made him
clench his teeth with rage and mortification.
</p>

<p>
But, as the hot month of September is not meant for hard
fagging, the whole party were back at the house by luncheon-time,
and the united spoil of all the bags was duly laid out
by braces on the pavement of the court-yard, and a goodly
show it made.
</p>

<p>
After shooting in the morning and forenoon, as there were
three sets of lovers among the party at Earlshaugh, much of
the time was spent in riding, driving, and rambling about
the grounds and their vicinity, while Roland found a
congenial task in teaching Annot to ride, as he had procured a
most suitable pad for her, by the aid of old Johnnie Buckle,
at the Cupar Tuesday Fair; and just then nothing seemed
to exist for him but Annot's white soft cheek, her golden
hair, and the graceful little figure that made all other women
look, to his eyes, angular and peculiar; and then truly he
felt that 'there are days on which heaven opens to us all,
though to many of us next day it shuts again.'  And shut
indeed it seemed to Malcolm Skene, who followed Hester
like her shadow, and whose eyes often wore a tender and
wistful intensity as he gazed upon her soft dark ones without
winning one responsive glance; and he would seek to lure
her into the subject that was nearest his own heart&mdash;his
great love for her&mdash;while with the rest, but always somewhat
apart, they would ramble on by the silvery birches in the
Fairy's Den, by the King's Wood, with its great old oaks and
heaven-high Scottish firs that towered against the blue sky;
in the leafy dingles where the white-tailed rabbits skurried
out of their sandy holes, where the birds twittered overhead,
the black gleds soared skyward in the welkin, the dun deer
started from the rustling bracken and underwood, and so on
to where the woods grew more open, and there came distant
glimpses of the German Sea or perhaps of the Firth of Tay,
rippling in the glory of the evening sun as it set beyond the
Sidlaw Hills.
</p>

<p>
Unlike Maude and Elliot, who took their assured regard
with less demonstration, Roland and Annot Drummond&mdash;owing
doubtless to the impressible and effusive nature of the
latter young lady&mdash;were so much together, everywhere and
every way, as to provoke a smile among their friends and an
emotion of amusement, which certainly Hester Maule did
not share.
</p>

<p>
'Why did I come here after all?' she often asked of
herself, as her mind harked back to old days and dreams.  'I
could have declined that woman, old Deborah's invitation,
and Roland's too.  Save papa's suspicions, there was no
compulsion upon me.  Fool that I have been to come&mdash;yet,'
she would add with a bitter smile, 'I shall not wear my
heart on my sleeve.'
</p>

<p>
Thus she seemed to lead the van in every proposed
scheme for amusement, and the attentions of her old
admirer, Malcolm Skene, if they failed to win, at least
pleased and soothed her; and, watching her sometimes,
Roland would think&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Well, after all, I am glad to see her so happy.'
</p>

<p>
A ball had early been proposed, but through the opposition
or mal-influence of Mrs. Lindsay the scheme proved a
failure; visions of the large dining-hall gay with floral
decorations, the lines on the floor and the ball cloth smooth
and tight as a drum-head, passed away, and a simple,
half-impromptu carpet-dance was substituted; hired musicians
were procured from the nearest town, and all the invited&mdash;even
Hester&mdash;looked forward to a night of enjoyment; and,
sooth to say, since her visit she had sedulously done all in
her power to avoid meeting Roland alone&mdash;no difficult
matter, so occupied was he with Annot; and then Earlshaugh
was a large and rambling old house, intersected by tortuous
passages without end, little landings and flights of steps in
unexpected places, rooms opening curiously out of each
other, and turret stairs up and down, the result of repairs
and additions in past times: thus, while it was a glorious
old house for flirtation, for appointments and partings, it
was quite possible for two persons to reside therein and
yet meet each other seldom, unless they wished it to be
otherwise.
</p>

<p>
It was impossible for the mind of Hester not to dwell on
the time when Roland was&mdash;as she thought&mdash;her lover; of
rambles and conversations and silences that were eloquent,
and beatings of the heart in the bat-haunted gloaming, when
the Esk gurgled over its stony bed and the crescent moon
was in the violet-tinted sky.
</p>

<p>
She thought she had got over it all, but she had not yet&mdash;she
felt that she had not; but now Malcolm Skene was there,
and she might if she chose show Roland the sceptre of
power, and that the art of pleasing was still hers as ever.
</p>

<p>
Roland had actually been more than once on the point
of seeking some apologetic explanation with her; in his
inner consciousness he felt that he owed it to her; but he
shrank from it with a species of moral cowardice&mdash;he who
had hacked his way out of the carnage of Kashgate, and
ridden through the slaughter of other Egyptian fields; and
though he had often rehearsed in his mind the <i>amende</i> he
owed her, how could he dare to approach it?
</p>

<p>
'It was a mistake of his at Merlwood thinking that he
loved me,' Hester would ponder on the other hand; 'and
he did not know then&mdash;still less did I&mdash;that it was a
mistake; but I know it now!  The only thing left for me is to
school myself, if I can, to love him as a friend or sister, a
cousin merely.  But it is hard&mdash;hard after all; and for such
an artificial girl as Annot!'
</p>

<p>
Maude's carpet-dance&mdash;for the idea was hers&mdash;proved a
great success, and many were present to whom, as they have
no place in our story, we need not refer; but the music was
excellent, and from an arched and partially curtained recess
of the Red Drawing-room it swelled along the lofty ceilings
and through the stately apartment, on the floor of which the
dancers glided away to their hearts' content.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hawkey Sharpe, bold and unabashed, was there
attired <i>de rigueur</i> in evening costume; but even he did not
venture on asking Maude to favour him with one dance;
yet he ground his sharp teeth from time to time as he
watched her and Captain Elliot, and overheard some&mdash;but
only some of his remarks to her, though Hawkey had the
ears of a fox.
</p>

<p>
'Maudie, darling, I am afraid you are tired,' said Jack
tenderly, pausing for a moment.
</p>

<p>
'Already?  Not at all, Jack; I would go on for ever,'
exclaimed the girl, and they swept away again.
</p>

<p>
To her how delightful it was, waltzing with him&mdash;his hand
pressed lightly on her willowy waist, her fingers, gloved and
soft and slender, just resting on his shoulder; a faint perfume
of her silky hair, a drowsy languor in every movement and
in the whole situation.
</p>

<p>
'After we are married, Maudie,' whispered Jack, 'I am
sure I shall disapprove of waltzing.'
</p>

<p>
'Disapprove&mdash;why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because I shall hate to see you whirling away with
another.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't be a goose, Jack.'
</p>

<p>
'Won't I have the right to forbid you?'
</p>

<p>
'A right I shall not recognise.  You surely would not be
jealous of me?'
</p>

<p>
'Of you&mdash;no; but of others&mdash;a humiliating confession, is
it not?' he added, smiling tenderly down upon her.
</p>

<p>
Though it was all a hastily got up and <i>impromptu</i> affair,
Maude and Annot were radiantly happy; the latter in securing
such a lover as Roland Lindsay, with all his surroundings,
which she appreciated highly, as they far exceeded the most
brilliant hopes and aspirations of herself and her match-making
mother in South Belgravia.  Her soft cheeks flushed
and paled, and her tiny feet&mdash;for tiny they were as those of
Cinderella&mdash;beat responsive to the music; and in the fulness
of her own joy even her original emotions of covetousness,
and ambition perhaps, were dimmed or lessened; while the
dances which she had with Roland seemed quite unlike
those she had enjoyed with other men; even when Hawkey
Sharpe, who, being a Scotchman, danced of course, ploughing
away with the minister's good-natured daughter, cannoned
with some violence against them, and made Roland frown
and mutter under his moustache till he drew Annot into the
recess of a window, and while fanning her, and in doing so
lightly ruffling Her shining hair, talked that soft nonsense so
dear to them then.
</p>

<p>
'How childlike you are, Annot, in the brightness of your
joy and in your genuine love of amusement!' said he
admiringly, as he stooped over her.
</p>

<p>
'I feel as light as a bird when I hear good dance music
like that and have such a good partner as you, Roland,' she
exclaimed, looking up, her green hazel eyes beaming with
pleasure.
</p>

<p>
'How could it be otherwise,' said he, 'when,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "My love she's but a lassie yet,<br />
  A lightsome, lovely lassie yet."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
a sweet one that never had even a passing <i>penchant</i>, I am
sure, or perhaps a flirtation!'
</p>

<p>
'Yet having a very decided tendency thereto.' replied
Annot, with one of her arch smiles.  'But nothing more,
dear Roland, nothing more!' she added, perfectly oblivious
of poor Bob Hoyle and many other 'detrimentals,' as Mamma
Drummond called them.
</p>

<p>
'Have you never had even what the French call a <i>caprice</i>?'
he asked, with a soft laugh and a fond glance.
</p>

<p>
'Never&mdash;never&mdash;till&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Till when?'
</p>

<p>
'I came to Merlwood.'
</p>

<p>
'My little darling!'
</p>

<p>
'So Hester and Mr. Skene are dancing together again,'
said Annot, anxious to change what she deemed a dangerous
subject.  'I saw her dancing with Captain Elliot after you
resigned her.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;she seems enjoying herself, poor Hester!'
</p>

<p>
'I am so glad to see her with Mr. Skene.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because I hope they will marry yet, and bring their little
comedy to a close.'
</p>

<p>
'How a young girl's mind always runs on love and
marriage!' said Roland.  'But this little comedy you refer
to, I never heard of it, save from yourself.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!' replied Annot, who, from cogent reasons of her
own, was anxious to make the most of Skene's undoubted
admiration for Hester.  'I've noticed them greatly in
London.'
</p>

<p>
'I always knew that Malcolm was her unvarying admirer,
who singled her out in the Edinburgh assemblies and balls
elsewhere from the first, and had, of course, poured much
sweet nonsense into her pretty little ears&mdash;treasured flowers
she had worn, gloves, handkerchiefs, bits of ribbon, and all
that sort of thing&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Which you all do?'
</p>

<p>
'That I don't admit, Annot.'
</p>

<p>
'Anyway, this absurd appreciation of each other's society
was a source of great amusement to us in London,' she
continued, not very fairly, so far as concerned Hester; but then
Annot, a far-seeing young lady, was full of past preconceived
suspicions and of present plans of her own.
</p>

<p>
'However, Annot, this little affair is nothing to us&mdash;to
<i>me</i>,' added Roland, and oddly enough, with the slightest
<i>soupçon</i> of pique in his glance and tone, as he saw Malcolm
Skene, a tall and stately fellow, who might please any
woman's eye&mdash;and did please the eyes of many&mdash;leading his
dark-eyed and dark-haired cousin, not into the whirl of
dances, nor to the refreshment-room, but&mdash;as if almost
unconsciously&mdash;towards the entrance of the long and
dimly-lighted conservatory which opened off the Red
Drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
As Jack Elliot was too well-bred a man to attract attention
by dancing too much with Maude, his <i>fiancée</i>, the observant
Mr. Hawkey Sharpe saw, with no small satisfaction, that for
nearly the remainder of the night he bestowed the most of
his attention on strangers, wholly intent that Maude's little
entertainment should please all and go off well, and that
intention, which Mr. Sharpe misunderstood, was one of the
causes that led to a serious misadventure at a future time.
</p>

<p>
Old Gavin Fowler, as he carried Ponto home in his arms
to his own lodge, while the dog, conscious of kindness,
whined and licked his weather-beaten hands, had muttered
between his teeth to Roland:
</p>

<p>
'A better dog never entered a field!  Eleven years has
he followed me, and now he is thirteen years auld, and can
yet find game wi' the youngest and the best whelp we hae;
and to think that he should get sic a clowre from a clod
like that!  But dogs bark as they are bred&mdash;so does Hawkey
Sharpe!  He's like the witches o' Auchencraw; he'll get
mair for your ill than your gude.'
</p>

<p>
A proverb that means, favours are often granted an
individual through fear of his malevolence.
</p>

<p>
Roland felt all the words implied, and colouring, said,
pale with anger:
</p>

<p>
'He shall pay up this score and others, I hope, ere long,
Gavin.'
</p>

<p>
And Mrs. Lindsay placed her hand upon her heart, on
hearing of the episode, and was secretly thankful that the
only one who suffered from Hawkey's jealous vengeance was
poor Ponto, the pointer.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
HESTER RECEIVES A PROPOSAL.
</h3>

<p>
Annot was certainly curious to know what was passing
between the two whom she had seen wandering into the
cooler atmosphere of the conservatory; but she could not
at the same time relinquish the society of Roland, and to
suggest that they should adjourn thither might only mar the
end she wished&mdash;without any real affection for Hester&mdash;to
come to pass, as she had not been without her own suspicions
retrospectively.  But, sore though it was, we fear that the
heart of Hester Maule was not to be caught on the rebound.
</p>

<p>
And in dread and dislike of Annot's observation, her jests
and comments, she had&mdash;so far as she could&mdash;lately avoided
being, if possible, for a moment alone with Malcolm Skene,
or giving him an opportunity of addressing her, and he had
felt this keenly.
</p>

<p>
In the long drawing-room the dancing was still gaily in
progress, and the soft strains of Strauss went floating along
the leafy and gorgeous aisles of the conservatory, where
Skene and Hester had&mdash;so far as she was concerned&mdash;unconsciously
wandered.  She seated herself, wearily and
flushed with dancing, while he hung over her, with his
elbow resting on a shelf of flowers, while looking pensively
and tenderly down on her&mdash;on the heaving of her rounded
bosom, her long dark lashes, and the clear white parting of
the rich brown hair on her shapely head, longing with all
his soul to place his arms round her, and draw that beloved
head caressingly on his breast; and yet the words he said at
first were somewhat commonplace after all.  But Hester,
while slowly fanning herself to hide the tremulousness of her
hands, knew and felt intuitively that a scene between them
was on the tapis; and, deeming it inevitable at some time
or other, she thought the sooner it was over the better; and
in the then weariness of her heart, she felt a little reckless;
but his introductory remarks surprised her by their bluntness.
</p>

<p>
'My life now seems but one manoeuvre, Miss Maule&mdash;to
be alone with you for a moment or two.'
</p>

<p>
Hester made some inaudible reply; so he resumed:
</p>

<p>
'I have heard it said by some&mdash;by whom matters
not&mdash;that you are engaged, Miss Maule?'
</p>

<p>
'Then they know more than I do&mdash;but to whom have
my good friends assigned me?'
</p>

<p>
'To your cousin.'
</p>

<p>
'Roland!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'I am not engaged to Roland certainly,' replied Hester,
her lips and eyelashes quivering as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
'I thought not,' said Malcolm Skene, gathering courage;
'Miss Drummond seems to me his chief attraction.  If he
is as happy as I wish him, he will be the happiest of
deserving men.'
</p>

<p>
'The phrase of a novel writer, Mr. Skene,' said Hester, a
little bitterly, as she thought over some episodes at
Merlwood; 'but do not talk so inflatedly of what men deserve.
The best of them are often unwise, unkind, unjust.'
</p>

<p>
'Do not blame all men for the faults perhaps of one,'
said Skene at haphazard, and a little unluckily, as the speech
went home to Hester's heart.  She grew pale, as if he had
divined her secret.
</p>

<p>
'I do not understand you,' she faltered a little haughtily,
while flashing one upward glance at him.
</p>

<p>
'Considering the way you view men now, and the way
you avoid or rebuff me, I wonder that I have got a word
with you, as I do to-night.'
</p>

<p>
'Do I rebuff you?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;to my sorrow, I have felt it.'
</p>

<p>
'Sorrow&mdash;of what do you really accuse me?'
</p>

<p>
'Treating me with coldness, distance&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I am not aware&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;' she paused, not
knowing what to say.
</p>

<p>
'Hester&mdash;dearest Hester,' said he in a low and earnest
voice, while stealing nearer her and assuring himself by one
swift glance that they were alone in the conservatory; 'let
me call you so, were it only for to-night&mdash;you know how
long I have loved you, and surely you will love me a little
in time.  I know how true, how tender of heart you are; I
know, too, that I have no rival in the present&mdash;with the past
I have nothing to do; but tell me, even silently, by one
touch of your hand, that you love me in turn, or will try to
love me in time, Hester&mdash;dear, dear Hester!'
</p>

<p>
She opened her lips, but no sound came from them, and
her interlaced hands trembled in her lap, for the 'scene'
had gone somewhat beyond her idea in depth and earnestness;
and she felt that Malcolm Skene's deduction as regarded
there being no rival in the present was a mistake in
one sense.
</p>

<p>
Encouraged by her silence, and construing it in his own
favour, little conceiving that her head was then full of a false
idol, he resumed:
</p>

<p>
'Hester, ever since I first saw and knew you, it has been
the great hope of my existence to make you my wife.'
</p>

<p>
Still the girl was voiceless, and felt chained to her
seat.
</p>

<p>
She could feel&mdash;yea, could hear her heart beating painfully,
as she had a pure regard and most perfect esteem for
the young fellow by her side; and thought that to the end
of her days the perfume of the lily of the valley, of
stephanotis, and other plants close by would come back to
memory with Malcolm's voice, the strains of Strauss, the
strange atmosphere of the conservatory, and the dull sense
of unreality that was over her then.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Hester, will you not tell me that you will try to love
me&mdash;to love me a little?  Have you not a single word to
give me?'
</p>

<p>
Passionately earnest were his handsome eyes&mdash;anxious and
eager was his lowered voice and the expression of his clearly
cut face.  He said nothing to her, as other men might have
done, of his fortune, of his estate, of his lands of Dunnimarle
that overlooked the Forth, of his prospects or his future; all
such items were forgotten in the present.  Neither did he
urge that he was going far&mdash;far away from her soon&mdash;much
sooner than he had then the least idea of&mdash;to enhance his
value in her eyes, or win her interest in his favour; for even
that, too, he forgot.
</p>

<p>
She looked up at him with her soft, velvety, dark-blue
eyes suffused, gravely and kindly; the charming little tint
gone from her rounded cheeks; her whole face looking very
sweet and fair, but not wearing the expression of one who
listened with happiness to a welcome tale of love.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, why do you say all this to me, Mr. Skene&mdash;Malcolm
I shall call you for old acquaintance' sake&mdash;why ask me to
marry you?'
</p>

<p>
'Why? a strange question, Hester,' said he, a little baffled
by her apparent self-possession, while tremulous with joy to
hear for the first time his Christian name upon her lips.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;why?' she asked, wearily and sadly.
</p>

<p>
'Because I love you as much as it is in the nature of an
honest man to love a woman.'
</p>

<p>
'But&mdash;but I do not return the sentiment&mdash;I cannot love
you as you would wish.'
</p>

<p>
'Not even in the end, Hester?'
</p>

<p>
'What end?'
</p>

<p>
'Any time I may give you and hopefully wait for?'
</p>

<p>
She shook her head and cast down her white eyelids.
</p>

<p>
'And yet no one else seeks your love?' said he a little
reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
'No one else.'
</p>

<p>
'Can I never make you care for me?' he urged in a kind
of dull desperation.
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me&mdash;but I do not think so; my regard, my
friendship and gratitude will ever be yours; but please&mdash;please,'
she added almost piteously, 'do not let us recur to
this matter again.'
</p>

<p>
'You feel the impossibility&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Of receiving your words as you wish.'
</p>

<p>
'You are at least candid with me, Hester; and I shall,
indeed, trouble you no more.'
</p>

<p>
He spoke with more grief than bitterness, as he dropped
the little and softly gloved hand which he had captured for
a moment.
</p>

<p>
She then passed it over his arm and rose, as if to show
that all was over and that they were to return to the
drawing-room&mdash;which she now deeply regretted having quitted&mdash;and
with them the dancing, the joy, and the brilliance of Maude's
little fête had departed for the night.
</p>

<p>
Skene felt that nothing was left for him now but to quit
Earlshaugh at once, and the time and the hour came sooner
than he expected, and all the more welcome now.
</p>

<p>
But the adventures of the night&mdash;adventures in which
Mr. Hawkey Sharpe bore a somewhat prominent part&mdash;were not
yet over.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
MR. SHARPE MAKES A MISTAKE.
</h3>

<p>
Maude, though she knew not then the reason, had seen how
Hester Maule, after coming from the conservatory, with a
kind of good-night bow to Skene, had abruptly quitted the
dancers, and looking pale, ill, and utterly out of spirits, had
retired to her own room, whither she soon accompanied her;
but failing to learn the reason of her discomposure, was
returning downstairs to have one last turn with Jack Elliot,
when she suddenly met Mr. Hawkey Sharpe, the result of
whose attentions to the wine in the refreshment-room was
pretty apparent in his face and watery gray eyes, and he
paused unsteadily with a hand on the great oaken banisters.
</p>

<p>
As Maude came tripping down the broad stone staircase
with leisurely grace and clad in a soft and most becoming
dress, one of those 'whose apparently inexpensive simplicity
men innocently admire, and over the bills for which husbands
and fathers wag their heads aghast,' he glanced appreciatively
at her snowy neck and shoulders, where her girlish plumpness
hid even the small collar-bones; at her beautiful,
blooming face, her sunny hair; her petulant, scornful mouth,
and delicate profile; while she, with some remembrance of
how he had acquitted himself among the dancers, and when
waltzing, in attempting to reverse, had spread dismay around
him, for a moment felt inclined to smile.
</p>

<p>
Wine gave Hawkey Sharpe fresh courage, and just then
some new thoughts had begun to occur to him.
</p>

<p>
He had seen that&mdash;unlike young Malcolm Skene, who
hovered about Hester like her shadow, and unlike Roland,
who was never absent from the side of Annot&mdash;Captain
Elliot and Maude were not apparently overmuch together;
for in the assured position of their love and engagement they
seemed in society very much like other persons.  He was
ignorant of the mystery that there could be
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Sighs the deeper for suppression,<br />
  And stolen glances sweeter for the theft,'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and in the coarseness of his nature and lack of fine perception
he mistook the situation, and began to think that,
notwithstanding all he heard mooted, and notwithstanding the fact
of seeing a letter addressed in Maude's handwriting to the
gentleman in question, there might be 'nothing in it,' but
perhaps an incipient flirtation; and he had resolved on the
first opportune occasion to renew his pretensions, as the
Captain had evidently danced much with other girls&mdash;perhaps,
he thought, had preferred them&mdash;during the past
night.
</p>

<p>
And now it seemed the time had come; and, over and
above all his extreme assurance, he thought to win through
her terror and necessity of temporizing for appearance' sake
what she never might yield to any regard for himself; and
even now, as he prepared to address her, anger, fear, and a
sickly sense of humiliation suddenly came into the heart of
Maude, though a moment before it had been beating happily
with thoughts that were all her own.
</p>

<p>
'I hope,' said he, with what he meant for a smile, but was
more like a grimace, 'that you enjoyed the dancing to-night,
Miss Lindsay?'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks,' replied Maude curtly.  'I hope you, too, have
been amused,' she added, making a side step to pass, but, as
on a previous occasion, he barred the way, and said:
</p>

<p>
'I did not venture to ask you for one dance, even.'
</p>

<p>
Maude, who deemed his presence there, though at the
invitation most probably of her stepmother, presumption
enough, smiled coldly and haughtily, and was about to pass
down with a bow, which might mean anything, when, still
opposing her progress, he said, while eyeing her fair beauty
with undisguised admiration, and with a would-be soft voice,
which, however, was rather 'feathery':
</p>

<p>
'Have you quite forgotten the subject on which I last
addressed you?'
</p>

<p>
'The subject!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'I have not forgotten your profound presumption, Mr. Sharpe,
as I then called it, if it is to that you refer,' replied
Maude, trembling with anger.
</p>

<p>
'Presumption!  You so style my veneration&mdash;my
regard&mdash;my&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Take care what you say, sir, and how you may provoke
my extreme patience too far,' interrupted Maude, her face
now blanched and pale.
</p>

<p>
'Your patience! <i>that</i> for it!' said he, suddenly snapping
his fingers, and giving way to a sudden gust of coarse anger
that caused his cheeks to redden and his eyes to gleam.
'It is your fear of me&mdash;your fear of me for your brother and
his popinjay friends that gives you what you pretend to call
patience, Maude Lindsay, and by the heavens above us,' he
continued, wine and rage mounting into his brain together,
'by the heavens above us, I say, if that fellow Elliot&mdash;
</p>

<p>
What he was about to say remains unknown, as it was
suddenly cut short.  A hand from behind was laid firmly on
his right ear, and by that he was twisted round, flaming with
rage, fury, and no small amount of pain, to find himself
confronted by the calm, stern, and inquiring face of the very
person he referred to&mdash;Captain Elliot.
</p>

<p>
There was a half-minute's pause after the latter flung
Hawkey Sharpe aside.
</p>

<p>
The steward glared at his assailant, who scarcely knew
what to make of the situation, a sound like a hiss escaping
through his teeth in his speechless rage and sense of affront,
he clenched his hands till the spiky nails pierced his flesh.
He grew deadly pale, and, with an almost grotesque expression
of hate there is no describing in his pale, shifty, and
watery eyes, he turned away muttering something deeply
and huskily; while with a smile of disdain Jack Elliot drew
the trembling girl's arm through his own and led her
downstairs; but her dancing was over for that night.
</p>

<p>
'Maudie, darling, is that fellow mad?  What the deuce
is all this about?' asked Elliot, full of concern and surprise.
</p>

<p>
'Jack, dear Jack,' said Maude beseechingly, and in tears
now, 'I implore you not to speak to Roland of this unseemly
episode.'
</p>

<p>
'The fellow seems to have taken too much wine.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Jack, and forgot himself.'
</p>

<p>
'But he should have remembered you, and who you are.'
</p>

<p>
'But you don't know&mdash;you can't know, how Roland is
situated,' said Maude, in a breathless and broken voice.
</p>

<p>
'I suspect much; but there&mdash;don't weep, Maude; the
fellow's whole existence is not worth one of your tears.'
</p>

<p>
Maude was full of fear and distress for what might ensue
if Roland knew all.  Alas! she could very little foresee what
<i>did</i> ensue.
</p>

<p>
But notwithstanding his promise to Maude, Elliot was too
puzzled by the apparent mystery, and her too evident sense
of grief and mortification, not to make some small reference
to the affair when he and Roland met for a farewell cigar in
the smoke-room, after the last of the guests had driven
away.  He kept, however, Maude's name out of the
matter.
</p>

<p>
'I am loth, Roland, to have an unseemly row with one of
your dependents; but, d&mdash;n me, if I don't feel inclined to
lash that fellow&mdash;Sharpe, I think, his name is!'
</p>

<p>
'He is certainly an underbred fellow,' said Roland
uneasily.
</p>

<p>
'Then why not send him to the right-about?'
</p>

<p>
'Easier said than done, Jack&mdash;if you knew all,' said
Roland, almost with a groan; 'but has he been rude to
you?'
</p>

<p>
'To me&mdash;well&mdash;yes, in a way he has.'
</p>

<p>
'With all his impudent would-be air of ease, it is evident
he has none, as one may see at a glance,' said Skene, who
had been smoking moodily in a corner, 'he is a man who
does not know what to do with his legs and arms, or to
seem in any way at ease like a gentleman.'
</p>

<p>
'I feel at times that I would like to kick the fellow,' said
Roland, with a sudden gush of anger, 'when he sits with
that aggravating smile and see-nothing look on his face, yet
"taking stock" of everyone and everything all round&mdash;all
the while answering me so softly, when he knows that I am
burning with contempt and dislike of him.  If he would get
into a passion and fly out I would respect him more, but he
seems to be for ever biding his time&mdash;his time for what?'
added Roland, almost to himself.
</p>

<p>
'Passion?  You should have seen him to-night!' said
Elliot, who, unfortunately for himself, had not yet seen the
tail of the storm he had roused; 'but why give him
house-room, I say?'
</p>

<p>
'He is just now a necessary evil&mdash;a little time, Jack, and
you shall know all,' replied Roland in a somewhat dejected
voice; so Elliot said no more.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the subject of these remarks had betaken him
to his own apartments, and certainly as he had ascended the
old hollowed steps of the turret stair that led thereto they
seemed, according to the Earlshaugh legend, to lead down
rather than up.
</p>

<p>
'I'll be even with you, Miss Maude Lindsay, some fine
day&mdash;see if I am not!' he muttered as he went; 'your high
and mighty hoity-toity airs will be the ruin of you and yours.
And as for that fellow Elliot, I'll take change out of
him&mdash;make cold meat of him, by heaven, if I can!'
</p>

<p>
Sobered by rage he reached his peculiar sanctum, and sat
down there to scheme out revenge, through the medium of
a briar-root from his rack of pipes, and brandy and soda
from a cellarette he possessed.
</p>

<p>
'I'll marry that girl Maude&mdash;or&mdash;by Jove! not a bad
idea, the <i>other</i> one, with the golden hair, if old Deb fails me,
which I can scarcely think.  The little party with the golden
hair seems game for anything,' he added, showing more
acuteness than Roland in the matter.  'Why shouldn't I?  I
am going in for respectability now, and I rather flatter
myself I am as good as any of that Brummagem lot downstairs,
for all their coats of arms, pedigrees, and bosh!  I'm
in clover here&mdash;in society now, and, by Jove, I'll keep to it.
But, Deb,' he continued talking aloud, as the new beverage
cast loose his tongue, 'her heart is in a bad way&mdash;devil a
doubt of that!  The doctors assure me of it&mdash;is breaking
up&mdash;breaking up&mdash;tell more to me than they have done to her;
and that she may go off any time like a farthing candle!
Poor Deb&mdash;she is not half a bad sort&mdash;yet I wish she
would settle her little affairs and&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
A sound made him look round, and he saw his sister
looking pale&mdash;white indeed&mdash;and weary, with an unpleasant
expression in her cold, deep eyes, and a palpable knit on
her usually smooth and lineless forehead.
</p>

<p>
'How much had she overheard?' was Hawkey's first
fearful thought.
</p>

<p>
'My dear Deb,' he stammered, 'I was just thinking that
you should make the whole of that pack clear out of the
house&mdash;they are too much for you, and the house is yours!
Have a little brandy and water, Deb&mdash;you look so ill!
Poor, dear Deb,' he continued in a maudlin way, 'if
anything happened to you, you know how I should sorrow
for it.'
</p>

<p>
'I have no intention of affording you that opportunity
yet,' she replied, with something of a flash in her eyes.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
MALCOLM SKENE.
</h3>

<p>
The sportsmen assembled next morning a little later than
usual, and after hastily partaking of coffee, were about to set
forth after the partridges, with dogs, keepers, and beaters, to
a particular spot where Gavin Fowler assured them that the
coveys were so thick as to cover the ground, when Malcolm
Skene, whom all were beginning to miss, suddenly appeared,
but minus gun, shot belt, and other shooting paraphernalia,
yet with a brighter smile on his face that it had won
overnight.
</p>

<p>
'What is up, Malcolm?' asked Roland; 'don't you go
with us?'
</p>

<p>
'Impossible!  I have just had a telegram from the Colonel.
The corps is short of officers, from sickness, casualties, and
so forth; so I must resign my leave and start at once.'
</p>

<p>
'For the depôt?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;for Egypt,' continued Skene, 'so I must be off.
Let me have a trap, Roland, that I may catch the up train
for the South.'
</p>

<p>
'This is sudden!' exclaimed several.
</p>

<p>
'Sudden indeed&mdash;but no less welcome,'
</p>

<p>
'I am so sorry, old fellow!' exclaimed Roland, 'when the
birds are in such excellent order, too.'
</p>

<p>
'I can scarcely realize it,' said Skene, whose thoughts were
not with the birds certainly.  'In a fortnight, I shall be
again in my fighting kit and in the land of the Pharaohs.'
</p>

<p>
Ignorant of what had so suddenly transpired, Hester, for
whom he looked anxiously and wistfully, was lingering in her
room, till the shooting party should have gone forth,
unwilling to face Malcolm Skene after the interview of last
night, and full of a determination to return at once to
Merlwood, to her old life by the wooded Esk, with her
silver-haired father, his bubbling hookah, and his Indian
reminiscences&mdash;oh! how well she knew them all!  But
Maude, and even the selfish and apparently volatile Annot,
regarded the handsome fellow with deep interest, and the
lips of the former were white and quivering as she bade him
adieu.
</p>

<p>
'Good-bye, all you fellows;' he exclaimed, when old
Buckle came with the trap to the <i>porte-cochère</i>.  'Good-bye,
Roland and you, Jack&mdash;when shall we three meet again?  In
thunder and all the rest of it, no doubt.  Farewell, Miss
Lindsay&mdash;Maude I may call you just now&mdash;bid Hes&mdash;, your
cousin, adieu for me, and God keep you all till we meet once
more&mdash;if ever!' he added, under his moustache.
</p>

<p>
Another moment he was gone, and no trace remained of
him but the wheel-tracks in the avenue.
</p>

<p>
'Good-bye&mdash;good-bye;' it sounded like a dirge in the air
of the warm autumn morning.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Malcolm&mdash;he is the king of good fellows,' said
Roland to his friends who were gathered in the entrance-hall,
just as Hester Maule, pale as a lily, after vainly practising a
little the art of smiling and looking happy in her mirror,
appeared at the foot of the staircase, and heard what had
occurred.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;Skene has just gone, poor fellow.  Should you not
have liked to have bade him farewell?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;of course,' said Hester, with colourless lips; but
thought, 'it is better not&mdash;better not <i>now</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'His last message was to <i>you</i>,' whispered Maude.
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;it will be my turn next, and yours too, Elliot,' said
Roland as he lit a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
'It but reminds me of Wolfe's song,' added Elliot cheerily,
as he sang in a tragic-comic way&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Let mirth and wine abound.<br />
  The trumpets sound,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the colours flying are, my boys!<br />
  'Tis he, you, or I,<br />
  Whose business is to die;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then why should we be melancholy, boys,<br />
  Whose business is to die?'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Come along&mdash;here are the dogs.'
</p>

<p>
'Skene's departure seems to have upset you girls,' said
Roland, 'and now, Hester, my dear cousin,' he added in a
blundering way, 'you look as pale as if Melancholy had
marked you for her own.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't jest, Roland,' said Maude; 'Malcolm Skene looks
like one who has a history behind him, and a strange destiny
before him.  Only think, Roland,' she added in a whisper,
as she drew her brother aside; 'he proposed to Hester in
the conservatory last night!'
</p>

<p>
'And&mdash;and she&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Refused him.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
Maude only shook her pretty head; but his heart told
him too probably <i>why</i>, and for a time his conscience smote
him.
</p>

<p>
'Don't you think she was foolish?' asked Maude; 'I
certainly told her that I thought so, as Malcolm is such a
lovable fellow.'
</p>

<p>
'And what did she say?'
</p>

<p>
'Replied, with a feeble laugh, that she meant to die an
unappropriated blessing.'
</p>

<p>
'What is that, Maudie?'
</p>

<p>
'An old maid.'
</p>

<p>
'Nonsense&mdash;a handsome girl like Hester!'
</p>

<p>
To do the latter justice, she asked herself more than once
why had she refused him, and for <i>what</i>?
</p>

<p>
Many may deem that Hester acted a foolish part: but
her heart was too sore, and still too full of regard for another
to find a place in it for the love of Malcolm Skene, though
she knew it had been hers in the past, ready to lay at her
feet.
</p>

<p>
Steadfast of purpose, she was, in some respects, a remarkable
girl, Hester Maule.  Roland, her companion in childhood,
as we have elsewhere stated, was the one love of her life.
</p>

<p>
'All of hers upon that die was thrown,' and her heart was
not to be caught on the rebound, through pique, pride,
soreness, or disappointment.
</p>

<p>
But now that Malcolm was gone, Hester in solitude could
not but give a few tears as she thought of his true regard
for her; his stately presence, his soft earnestness, and his
sad, tender eyes&mdash;thought over all that&mdash;but for Roland's
image&mdash;might have been; and of the high compliment
Skene's honest and gallant heart had paid her; but
all&mdash;even could she have wished it otherwise&mdash;was over now,
and he had gone to that fatal land of battle and disease,
where so many found their graves then!
</p>

<p>
Did Roland jest when he asked if Melancholy had marked
her for its own?  If so, it was a species of wound, and she
felt that 'it is only wounds inflicted by those we love whose
sting lasts.'
</p>

<p>
Maude and Annot, with the old groom, Johnnie Buckle,
as their <i>Escudero</i>, had gone for a 'spin' on their pads as far
as Kilmany, to visit the Gaules-Den, a deep ravine through
which a river runs; Mrs. Lindsay was in the seclusion of
her own room, as usual at that time of the day, when she
took some kind of drops for her heart, and Hester, left
alone to silence and solitude, mentally followed Malcolm
Skene in his journey southward.  Her hands were folded
idly in her lap; a kind of sad listlessness was all over her,
and her soft dark eyes were dreamily fixed on vacancy, and
seemed to see&mdash;if we may say so&mdash;visions, while, as on
yesternight, the perfume of the lily of the valley, of the
stephanotis, and other flowers was floating round her.
</p>

<p>
She thought she might have seen him once again had she
gone downstairs at the usual time&mdash;but have seen him to
what end or purpose, constituted as her mind was then?
Better not.
</p>

<p>
In these days it seemed to Hester that there was not one
of her actions which she did not repent of before it was half
conceived or half acted upon.
</p>

<p>
The forenoon sun soared hot and high, and the drowsy
flies and one huge humming bee, enclosed by the windows
of her room, made their useless journeys up and down the
panes, on which the climbing ivy pattered; the birds
twittered among the leaves of the latter; an occasional
dog barked in the stable-yard, and the voice of the
peacock&mdash;never pleasant at any time&mdash;was heard on the terrace
without; but soon other sounds&mdash;voices indicative of
excitement and alarm&mdash;caused her to rise, throw open a window
in the deep embayment of the ancient wall, and look
out.
</p>

<p>
Advancing across the emerald sward of the lawn, but
slowly and carefully, came a group&mdash;the sportsmen of the
morning, with their guns sloped on the shoulder or carried
under an arm, and the dogs cowering, as if overawed, about
their footsteps.
</p>

<p>
What was the cause of this?  What had happened?
</p>

<p>
Four men were bearing a fifth on a stretcher or hurdle of
some kind&mdash;a man either terribly wounded or dead, he lay
so still&mdash;so very still!
</p>

<p>
A half-stifled cry escaped Hester, as she rushed downstairs,
for some dreadful catastrophe had evidently taken
place!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
A FATAL SHOT.
</h3>

<p>
When the shooting party, after being somewhat delayed by
Skene's unexpected departure, was setting forth, Roland
and Elliot, with no small indignation, and confounded by
his profound assurance, saw Hawkey Sharpe join them,
belted, accoutred, gaitered, and gun in hand, looking quite
sobered and fresh, having doubtless just had from
Mr. Funnell 'a hair of the dog that bit him' overnight.
</p>

<p>
'That fellow here, actually&mdash;after all!' said Roland
through his clenched teeth, though Elliot had given him
but a vague outline of Sharpe's rudeness, remembering
Maude's earnest desire and evident anxiety.
</p>

<p>
While somewhat 'dashed' by the coolness of his reception
by all&mdash;even to old Ponto the setter, who gave him a wide
berth&mdash;Mr. Hawkey Sharpe was mean enough&mdash;or subtle
enough&mdash;to hammer a kind of excuse for 'some mistake'
he had made last night, attributing it to the wine he had
taken&mdash;mixing champagne and claret-cup with brandies and
soda&mdash;of all of which he had certainly imbibed freely, as his
still yellow-balled and bloodshot eyes bore witness.
</p>

<p>
Elliot heard him with a fixed stare of calm disdain;
while Roland, writhing in his soul, still temporized&mdash;despising
himself heartily the while&mdash;for the sake of appearances,
but determined now, before twenty-four hours were
past, to get at the bottom of the mystery&mdash;to ascertain the
real state of his affairs.
</p>

<p>
There was something in Jack Elliot's well-bred and steady
stare, as he focussed him with his eye-glass, that expressed
vague wonder, <i>insouciance</i>, and no small contempt; it enraged
Hawkey Sharpe and made his whole heart seem to burn in
his breast with hate and suppressed passion, while fixing his
own eyeglass defiantly and attempting suavely to say:
</p>

<p>
'Good-morning, Captain Lindsay&mdash;good-morning, gentlemen, <i>all</i>.'
</p>

<p>
Roland could scarcely master his passion or the impulse
to club his fowling-piece and knock the fellow down.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Sharpe,' said he in a low voice that seemed all
unlike his own, so low and husky was it, as he beckoned
Hawkey aside, 'considering the rudeness of which I understand
you were guilty last night, I wonder that you have the
bad taste to address me at all, or thrust yourself upon our
society.'
</p>

<p>
'Thrust&mdash;Captain Lindsay!' exclaimed Sharpe, in turn
suppressing his rage.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;I repeat that considering there was something&mdash;I
scarcely know what&mdash;amounting to a fracas between my
friend Captain Elliot and you, I also wonder&mdash;nathless your
relative and assumed position in this house&mdash;that you venture
to join my party this morning.'
</p>

<p>
It was the first time that Roland had spoken so plainly to
this obnoxious personage.
</p>

<p>
'I don't quite understand all your words imply,' replied
the latter with an assumption of dignity and would-be
<i>hauteur</i> that sat grotesquely upon him.  'I am in the house
of my sister, Mrs. Lindsay of Earlshaugh, who has accorded
me permission to shoot, and shoot I shall whether you like
it or not!'
</p>

<p>
'For the last time, I trust,' muttered Roland under his
moustache.
</p>

<p>
'That we shall see,' was the mocking remark of Hawkey,
who overheard him.
</p>

<p>
Roland turned abruptly away, loth to excite comment or
surprise among his friends by the strange bearing of one
deemed by them his mere dependent.
</p>

<p>
So the shooting progressed, and for a time without let or
impediment.  Away through the King's Wood and the
Fairy's Den went the sportsmen, over the harvest fields, so
rich in beauty to the picture-loving eye, by the green and
scented hawthorn hedgerows, where the golden spoil of the
passing corn carts remained for the gleaner; among brambles
and red fern&mdash;the crimson bracken that, according to the
Scottish proverb, brings milk and butter in October; firing
in line, as adjusted by old Gavin Fowler; and as their guns
went off, bang, bang, bang, in the clear and ambient air,
when the startled coveys went whirring up, the brown birds
came tumbling down with outspread wings, before the double
barrels.
</p>

<p>
If the autumn sunset in Scotland is lovely, not less so is
the autumn sunrise, when seen from the slope of some green
hill, like the spur of the Ochils that looks down on Logic,
while through pastoral valley and wooded haugh the white silver
mist is rolling.  'Then the tops of the trees seem at first
to rise above a country that is flooded, while the kirk spire
appears like some sea mark heaving out of the mist.  Then
comes a great wedge-like beam of gold, cutting deep
down into the hollows, showing the stems of the trees and
the roofs of the cottages, gilding barn and outhouse, making
a golden road through a land of white mist that seems
to rise on either side like the sea which Moses divided to
pass through dryshod.  The dew-drops on the sun-lighted
summit the feet rest upon, are coloured like precious stones
of every dye, and every blade of grass is beaded with the
gorgeous gems.'
</p>

<p>
And never do the deer look more graceful and beautiful
than when in autumn they leave their lair among the
bracken, when the blue atmosphere is on a Scottish
mountain side, and changing hues are on leafy grove and
heath-clad slope.
</p>

<p>
As the sportsmen, now pretty far apart, after beating
successfully up the slope of a stubble field on a hill-side,
came upon some aged and irregular hedgerows, full of gaps
and interspersed with stunted thorn-trees, and having on
each side a wet grassy ditch, the warning voice of the old
keeper was heard some paces in the rear:
</p>

<p>
'Tak' tent, gentlemen; tak' tent.  Nae cross shots here.
There is a different ground owre beyond.'
</p>

<p>
A covey of some twenty birds whirred up from a gap in
the hedge, and both Elliot and Hawkey Sharpe seemed to
fire at it.  We say seemed, as the former fired straight to
his front, the latter, who was on his right, obliquely to the
left; and then there came a sharp cry of anguish and pain
but seldom or never heard among a group of gay sportsmen.
</p>

<p>
'By the Lord, but he's done it at last,' cried old Fowler.
</p>

<p>
'I aye thocht he wad be the death on the field o'
somebody,' cried Jamie Spens, the ex-poacher, who was acting
as a beater.
</p>

<p>
'Sharpe's dune it at last,' cried Fowler again.
</p>

<p>
'What&mdash;who&mdash;what?' said a dozen voices.
</p>

<p>
'Murdered some ane&mdash;hang me if it isna Captain Elliot.
Sharpe's a devilish gleed gunner, if ever there was ane.'
</p>

<p>
Hawkey Sharpe heard these excited exclamations as if in
a dream, and as if heard by another and not himself.
</p>

<p>
He had unexpectedly seen Jack Elliot come, if not in
his line of fire, unseen by others, within range of it; and
though hitherto vaguely intent on mischief, a sudden, a
devil-born impulse came like a flash of lightning over him.
</p>

<p>
He fired, and Jack Elliot dropped like a stone!
</p>

<p>
The moment he had done so the heart of Hawkey
Sharpe seemed to stand still; enmity, rivalry, and affront
were all forgotten&mdash;seemed never to have existed.  There
was a roaring or surging of the blood in his ears, while a
sudden darkness seemed to fall upon the sunshiny landscape.
</p>

<p>
Was it accident or murder, he thought, and then felt
keenly that
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Murder, though it have no tongue, will speak<br />
  With most miraculous organ.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap23"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><br />
THE CITY OF THE CALIPHS&mdash;OCTOBER IN THE LAND OF<br />
THE PHARAOHS.
</h3>

<p>
Malcolm Skene had been three weeks among 'the flesh-pots
of Egypt,' as he wrote to Roland Lindsay, since he
landed from a great white 'trooper' at Alexandria.
</p>

<p>
It was now nearly the close of what is called the first
season in that part of the world&mdash;that of the inundation
of the Nile&mdash;which extends from the first of July to the
winter solstice, and when, till the month preceding Skene's
arrival, the whole country appears like one vast sea, in which
the towns and villages rise like so many islands, and when
the air is consequently moist, the mornings and evenings
foggy; and Malcolm thought of what brown October was
at home in his native land, where new vistas of hamlet
and valley are seen through the half-stripped groves, a few
hardy apples yet hang in the orchards, and nests are seen in
the hedges where none were seen before; where the flocks
are driven to fold as the dim sunset comes and the landscape
assumes its sober hue, while the call of the partridge
and of the few remaining birds on the low sighing wind,
fall sadly on the ear.  He thought of all this, and of the
thick old woods that sheltered his ancestral home, where
Dunnimarle looks down on the northern shore of the
Forth.
</p>

<p>
He often thought of Hester Maule too, and <i>why</i> she had
refused him, after all&mdash;after all he had been half led to
hope.
</p>

<p>
'So&mdash;so,' he reflected, 'we shall live out the rest of our
lives each without the other&mdash;forgetting and perhaps in time
forgot.'
</p>

<p>
Thought was not dead nor memory faint yet, and he
seemed, just then, to have no object to live for, save to kill
both, if possible, amid any excitement that came to hand,
and such was not wanting at that crisis both in Alexandria
and Grand Cairo.
</p>

<p>
No fighting&mdash;though such was expected daily&mdash;was going
on in the Upper Province or on its frontier; and to kill
time, Skene more than once resorted to the gambling booths
of the Greeks and Italians, as most of our officers did
occasionally&mdash;a perilous resource at times, as the reader
will admit, when we describe some of the events connected
with them; and, curious to say, it was amid such scenes that
Malcolm Skene was to hear some startling news of his
friends at Earlshaugh.
</p>

<p>
Long before this he had 'done' Cairo, and seen all that
was to been seen in that wonderful city, which, though less
purely Oriental than Damascus, yet displays a more lively
and varied kind of Oriental life than Constantinople itself;
for there are still to be found the picturesque scenes and
most of the <i>dramatis personæ</i> of the 'Arabian Nights'&mdash;and
found side by side with the latest results of nineteenth
century civilization.  'The short quarter of an hour's drive
from the railway station,' says M'Coan, 'transports you into
the very world of the Caliphs&mdash;the same as when Noureddin,
Abou Shamma, Bedredden Hassan, Ali Cogia, the Jew
Physician, and the rest of them played their parts any time
since or before Saladin.'
</p>

<p>
A labyrinth of dark and tortuous lanes and alleys is the
old city still&mdash;places where two donkeys cannot pass abreast,
and the toppling stories and outshoots shut out the narrowest
streak of sky; while the apparently masquerading crowd
below seems unchanged from what it was when Elliot
Warburton wrote of it a quarter of a century ago; 'Ladies
wrapped closely in white veils; women of the lower classes
carrying water on their heads, and only with a long blue
garment that reveals too plainly the exquisite symmetry of
the young, and the hideous deformity of the old; here are
camels perched upon by black slaves, magpied with white
napkins round their heads and loins; there are portly
merchants, with turbans and long pipes, smoking on their
knowing-looking donkeys; here an Arab dashes through the
crowd at almost full gallop; or a European, still more
haughtily, shoves aside the pompous-looking bearded throng;
now a bridal or circumcising procession squeezes along, with
music; now the running footmen of some Bey or Pacha
endeavour to jostle you to the wall, till they recognise
you as an Englishmen&mdash;one of that race whom they think
the devil can't frighten or teach manners to.'
</p>

<p>
Now the streets and the Esbekeyeh Square are dotted by
redcoats; the trumpets of our Hussars ring out in the
Abbassiyeh Barracks; the drums of our infantry are heard at
those of Kasr-el-Nil; and the pipes of the Highlanders ever
and anon waken the echoes of El Kaleh, or the wondrous
citadel of Saladin, with the 'March o' Lochiel,' or the
pibroch of 'Donuill Dhu.'
</p>

<p>
Skene and his brother-officers enjoyed many a cigar on
the low terrace in front of Shepheard's now historical hotel,
under the shade of the acacia trees, watching the changing
crowds in the modern street, which, with all its splendour,
cannot compare with the picturesqueness of older Cairo;
but the dresses are strangely beautiful, and the whole
panorama seems part of a stage, rather than real life; while
among the veiled women, the swarthy men in turban and
tarboosh, the British orderly dragoon clanks past, or groups
of heedless, thoughtless, and happy young officers set forth
in open cabs to have a day at the Pyramids&mdash;an institution
among our troops at Cairo&mdash;especially early in the day,
when the air has that purity and freshness peculiar to a
winter morning in Egypt, and towering skyward are seen
those marvels in stone, of which it has been said, that
'Time mocks all things, but the Pyramids mock time!' and
where the mighty Sphinx at their base, 'the Father of
Terrors,' has its stony eyes for ever fixed on the desert&mdash;the
gate of that other world, where the work of men's hands
ends, and Eternity seems to begin.
</p>

<p>
At this time several peculiar duties, exciting enough,
though not orthodox soldiering, devolved on the troops,
and more than once Malcolm Skene, as a subaltern, found
himself with a part of the picket aiding the miserable
Egyptian police in the now nightly task of closing and
clearing out the <i>Assommoirs</i> and <i>Brasseries</i>, gambling and
other dens, which were kept open with flaring lamps till
gun-fire&mdash;a task often achieved by the fixed bayonet and
clubbed rifle; and in the course of these duties he had
more than once come unpleasantly in almost personal contact
with Pietro Girolamo, a leading promoter and frequenter
of such places, and one of the greatest ruffians in Cairo or
Alexandria, under what is now known as the <i>Band</i> system.
</p>

<p>
One result of the leniency shown to the followers of
Arabi Pacha, who were allowed to escape or disperse after
Tel-el-Kebir, was a flooding of the country with armed
banditti, by whom some districts were absolutely devastated,
and with whom it was suspected that the native authorities
were in league, as the police always disappeared with a curious
rapidity whenever they were most required.  A 'Flying
Commission' was appointed to deal with these brigands,
but without much avail, though certainly some were
captured, tried, and hanged&mdash;even on the Shoubra Road, the
'Rotten Row' of the fashionable Cairenes.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Band</i> system, in which Pietro Girolamo figured so
prominently, is a murdering one by no means stamped out
by the presence even of our army of occupation, and is a
result of the pernicious habit of carrying weapons among
the lower class of Greeks and Italians; thus scarcely a
week passes without a stabbing affray.
</p>

<p>
In the Esbekeyeh Gardens, outside the theatre, some
high words passed one evening about a girl <i>artiste</i>, during
one of the <i>entr'actes</i>, between an Italian and Girolamo, who
laid the former dead by one blow of his poniard.  For this
he was tried before his Consulate and merely punished by
a nominal fine, while nightly the actress appeared on the
stage, draped in black for her lover, to sing her comic
songs.
</p>

<p>
'Cairo and all the large towns' (says the <i>Globe</i>) 'are infested
by the refuse of the Levant&mdash;hordes of Greeks of the criminal
class and of the most desperate character, with no more
respect for the sanctity of human life than a Thug.  These
men come here to spoil Egypt, and some of them are, in
addition, retained by private persons as bullies, if not
assassins.  Appeal to the Greek Consul, and he will tell
you that he can do nothing in regard to these idle and
disorderly characters, though the French, Italian, and German
authorities deport the same class of their own countrymen
on the first complaint.'
</p>

<p>
The reason of Pietro Girolamo transferring the scene of
his life, or operations, from Alexandria to Cairo was an
outrage in which he had been concerned a year or two
before this period.
</p>

<p>
In a café near the Place des Consuls were two respectable
and very beautiful girls who served as waitresses, till one
evening several carriages drove up and a number of ruffians,
armed with yataghan, pistol, and poniard, entered, and
instead of opposing them, every man in the café made his
escape.
</p>

<p>
'This girl's smiles would inspire a flame in marble!' cried
Girolamo, seizing one of the waitresses, whom his
companions carried off to the Rosetta Gate, where she was
savagely treated and left for dead by the wayside;
and&mdash;according to a writer in the <i>Standard</i>&mdash;only one of her
murderers&mdash;an Egyptian Bey&mdash;was punished by a fine.
</p>

<p>
'Life is short&mdash;what is the use of fussing about anything?'
was the philosophic remark of Pietro Girolamo, who was a
native of Cerigo (the Cythera of classical antiquity), and
latterly the 'Botany Bay' of the Ionian Isles.
</p>

<p>
All unaware that this personage was in league with the
proprietors&mdash;if not actually one&mdash;of a handsome roulette
saloon, in a thoroughfare near the Esbekeyeh Gardens&mdash;a
place from where it was said no man ever got home alive
with his winnings&mdash;Malcolm Skene, then in the mood to do
anything to teach him to forget, if possible, Hester Maule
and that night in the conservatory at Earlshaugh, had spent
on hour or so watching the fatal revolving ball, and risking
a few coins thereon, after which he seated himself to enjoy
a cigar, a glass of wine, and a London newspaper, at a little
marble table, under a flower-decorated awning, in front of
the edifice.
</p>

<p>
Malcolm had been deep in the columns of home news,
while sipping his wine from time to time&mdash;wine that was
not the Mareotic vintage so celebrated by Strabo and
Horace, but of the common espalier trees in the
Delta&mdash;before he became aware that he had a companion at his
table similarly engaged, but in the pages of the obnoxious
<i>Bosphore Egyptien</i>.
</p>

<p>
He was a striking and picturesque-looking fellow in the
prime and strength of manhood.  Though somewhat hawk-like
in contour, his features were fine and dark; his
eyes and moustache jetty black&mdash;the former keen, and
his knitted brows betokened something of a stern and
savage nature.  He was well armed with a handsome
poniard and pistols, and his dress resembled the Hydriote
costume, which is generally of dark material, with wide blue
trousers descending as far as the knee, a loose jacket of
brown stuff braided with red, and an embroidered skull-cap
with a gold tassel.
</p>

<p>
Furtively, above his paper, he had been eyeing from time
to time the unconscious Skene, in whose grave face he was
keen enough to trace a mixture of power and patience, of
concentrated thought without gloom; a face well browned
by exposure, a thick dark moustache, and expression that
savoured of the resolution and perfect assurance of the
genuine Briton; by all of which he was no way deterred, as
the picturesque-looking rascal was no other than Pietro
Girolamo, the perpetrator of so many unpunished outrages.
</p>

<p>
Malcolm Skene was intent on his paper, and read calmly
from column to column, till a start escaped him on his eye
catching the following paragraph:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Misfortune seems to attend the sporting season at Earlshaugh,
in Fifeshire.  A short time since we had to record
the accidental&mdash;or supposed accidental&mdash;shooting of one of
the guests&mdash;a distinguished young officer; and now we have
to add thereto, the mysterious disappearance of the host,
Captain Roland Lindsay, who, when covert shooting last
evening, disappeared, and as yet cannot be traced, alive or
dead.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Skene started, and for a moment the paper dropped from
his hand.
</p>

<p>
'Dogs dream of bones and fishermen of fish, but what
the devil are you dreaming of?' said a voice in rather
tolerable English, and Malcolm found himself seated face to
face with Pietro Girolamo!
</p>

<p>
With an unmistakable expression of annoyance and disdain,
if not positive disgust in his face, Skene rose to leave
the table, when the hand of the other was lightly laid on his
arm, and Pietro said with mock suavity;
</p>

<p>
'The Signor will make his apologies?'
</p>

<p>
'For what?' asked Malcolm bluntly.
</p>

<p>
'Permitting his English paper to touch my boot just
now.'
</p>

<p>
'Absurd; I merely dropped it,' said Malcolm Skene,
turning away and about to look at the paragraph again.
</p>

<p>
'You must, you shall apologize!' cried the Levantine
bully, his sparkling eyes flaming and his pale cheek
reddening with rage and rancour.
</p>

<p>
'This is outrageous.  Stand back, fellow!' cried Malcolm,
laying his left hand on the scabbard of his sword to bring
the hilt handy.
</p>

<p>
'I mean what I say, Signor,' cried the Greek, snatching
away the paper and treading it under foot.
</p>

<p>
'And so do I,' replied Malcolm, making a forward stride.
</p>

<p>
The hand of the Greek was wandering to the poniard in
his girdle.  Malcolm knew that in another moment it would
be out; but, disdaining to draw his sword in an open
thoroughfare and upon such an adversary, he clenched his
right hand and dealt him, straight out from the shoulder, a
blow fairly under the left ear that stretched him senseless in
a heap on the pavement beside the marble table.
</p>

<p>
Thinking that he had sufficiently punished the fellow's
overbearing insolence, Malcolm, with his usually quiet blood
at fever heat, muttering with a grim laugh, 'That was not a
bad blow for a kail-supper of Fife,' was turning away to leave
the spot, when a dreadful uproar in the café behind him
made him pause, and hearing shouts for succour in English
he at once re-entered it.
</p>

<p>
There he found a number of Europeans and of British
officers&mdash;chiefly middies&mdash;who had come by rail from
Alexandria for a 'spree' in the city of the Caliphs, engaged
in a fierce <i>mêlée</i> with a number of those ruffians who frequent
such places.
</p>

<p>
The vicinity of the wretched roulette-table had been very
much crowded, and a dozen or so of these thoughtless young
Britons, who could not get near enough to stake their money
personally, had been passing it on from one to another to
stake it on the colours.  A trivial dispute had occurred,
and then a Greek ruffian, who was well known to be a terror
to every gambling saloon, rushed forward with his cocked
revolver, savagely resolute, and demanded as his, 'every
piastre&mdash;yea, every para on the tables'&mdash;a demand not at all
uncommon by such persons in such places.  Greeks came
in from all points, armed with cudgels and poniards, and in
a moment a battle-royal ensued.  The roulette-table was
overturned, the chairs smashed, and bloodshed became
plain on every hand.
</p>

<p>
While plunging into the <i>mêlée</i> to rescue more than one
lad in peril, Malcolm Skene towered above them all, in his
herculean strength; and as he laid about him with a cudgel
he had found, there floated through his mind a sense of rage
and mortification at what Hester Maule would think if he
perished in a brawl so obscure and disreputable.
</p>

<p>
'Take, cut, and burn!' was the cry of the Greek, a local
laconism, signifying 'take their money, burn their houses,
cut their throats!'
</p>

<p>
'Kill the Frankish dogs, these smokers and pilaff eaters!'
shouted Girolamo, who had now gathered himself up and
plunged into the fray, intent only on putting his poniard
into Skene.
</p>

<p>
But the latter, now relinquishing the cudgel, achieved the
feat which afterwards found its way into more than one
British print.
</p>

<p>
From the gambling saloon there was only one issue, down
a narrow passage, in which a number of the rabble had taken
post on both sides, and with knife and club allowed none
to pass, so that the place soon became a species of shamble.
Perceiving this, Malcolm Skene&mdash;bearing back the seething
mass of yelling Greeks, Italians, and Levantine scum, who,
with glaring black eyes, set white teeth, and visages pallid
and distorted with avarice and the lust of blood and cruelty,
surged about him with knife and cudgel, impeding and
wounding each other in their frantic efforts to get at
him&mdash;dragged up a couple of Greeks, one in each hand, and
by sheer dint of muscular strength lifting them off the floor,
and using their bodies as shields on each side, he charged
right through the passage and gained the street, where he
flung them down, gashed and bleeding from cuts and stabs
by the misdirected weapons of their compatriots, while he
escaped almost without a scratch; gathered about him his
companions, all of whom had suffered more or less severely,
and getting cabs they drove to the barracks.
</p>

<p>
For this affair Pietro Girolamo was arrested in the Shoubra
Road, and brought before the Greek Consul after twenty-four
hours' incarceration in the Zaptieh; but as usual, like
all the rogues of his nationality, he claimed protection under
the Alexandrian Capitulations, and went forth free into the
streets again.
</p>

<p>
Malcolm Skene soon dismissed the row from his thoughts,
but not the newspaper paragraph in the perusal or
consideration of which he had been so roughly interrupted; and
he pondered deeply and vainly on what was involved by the
mysterious and alarming&mdash;'disappearance at Earlshaugh.'

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><br />
JACK ELLIOT'S PERIL.
</h3>

<p>
We have anticipated some of the occurrences referred to in
the last chapter, but shall relate them in their place.
</p>

<p>
Gathering in an excited group at the scene of the
catastrophe, the sportsmen, keepers, and beaters found
Elliot reclining against, or clinging to the stem of a tree in
the old hedge, looking very pale, with his chest all bloody&mdash;at
least his shirt dyed crimson, and divested of his coat
and vest, which he had thrown off.
</p>

<p>
Spared by what he had done, the moment Hawkey Sharpe
had seen his victim fall&mdash;the moment his finger had pulled
the trigger&mdash;the savage and secret exultation that had filled
his heart passed away.
</p>

<p>
He felt as if on the verge of a giddy precipice, over which
he dared not look; yet he was compelled to confront the
scene, and to proceed&mdash;but apparently with lead-laden
feet&mdash;with the others, to where his victim was now supported
in the arms of Gavin Fowler and Spens, the beater.
</p>

<p>
For a minute the intended assassin scarcely seemed to
breathe, and to have but one wish&mdash;that the deed were
undone, for the hot blood that prompted it was cool enough
now, and the instincts of revenge had grown dull.  Terror
seized his soul, and his gaze wandered in the air, on the
while flying clouds, on the yellow stubble fields and waving
woods; but he nerved himself to approach the startled and
infuriated group, whose menacing eyes were on him; and
he nerved himself also to act a part, or, if not, lose his
senses, and with them, everything.
</p>

<p>
He felt that beyond cheating, cardsharping, jockeying at
horse races, and peculation at Earlshaugh, he had taken a
mighty stride in crime, and that mingling curiously with his
craven fear, there was an insane recklessness&mdash;a wild
incoherence about his brain and heart, with a sickening
knowledge that if Captain Elliot died, he&mdash;Hawkey Sharpe&mdash;would
be <i>that</i> which he dared not name to himself, even in
thought.
</p>

<p>
Hence his apparent sorrow and compunction seemed,
and perhaps were, genuine <i>pro tem.</i>, but the outcome of
selfishness.
</p>

<p>
'How in Heaven's name came this to pass&mdash;how did it
happen?' demanded Roland, his eyes blazing as he fixed
them on Sharpe.
</p>

<p>
'It was an accident&mdash;an entire accident,' faltered the
latter.  'The leaves of a turnip twisted round my right
ankle, causing me to stumble and my rifle to explode.'
</p>

<p>
'A likely thing,' growled Jamie Spens, the beater, with a
scowl in his eyes.  'Ye were oot o' the belt o' neeps at the
time; but I've aye thocht ye wad pot some puir devil, as
ye have done the Captain.'
</p>

<p>
'Silence, you poaching&mdash;&mdash;,' began Sharpe in a furious
voice; but Roland interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
'Stand back, sir.  This is no time for words.  "Accident,"
you say.  To me it seems a piece of cowardly revenge&mdash;a
case for the police and the Procurator-Fiscal.'
</p>

<p>
At these words Hawkey Sharpe grew, if possible, paler
still, as they were the echoes of his own fears, and drew
sullenly back.
</p>

<p>
'My poor, dear fellow&mdash;Elliot&mdash;Jack,' exclaimed Roland,
kneeling down by his friend's side, 'are you much
hurt&mdash;tell me?'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot say,' replied Elliot faintly.  'I feel as if my
breast was scorched with fire&mdash;the charge, or some of it,
seems thereabout.'  Then, after a pause, he added in a
husky voice: 'This horrible accident is most inopportune,
when my leave is running out, and I am so soon due at
headquarters.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't bother about that, dear Jack, I'll make all that
right&mdash;meantime your hurt must be instantly seen to.  Jamie
Spens, run, as if for your life, my man, to the stables; get a
good horse from Buckle, and ride to Cupar on the spur for
the doctors&mdash;send a couple, at least.'
</p>

<p>
'Let me&mdash;let me go!' urged Hawkey Sharpe, in a breathless
voice.
</p>

<p>
'You&mdash;be hanged!' cried old Fowler, who, like all the
people on and about the estate, hated the tyrannical
steward.
</p>

<p>
So the ex-poacher was away on his errand&mdash;speeding
across the fields like a hare.
</p>

<p>
'Now, my lads,' cried Roland, after having, with soldier-like
promptitude, secured a handkerchief folded as a pad,
by another torn into bandages, across the wound; 'quick
with that iron hurdle,' pointing to one in a gap of the hedge;
'hand it here to form a litter.'
</p>

<p>
Roland, like Elliot, had faced danger and death too often
to be made a woman by it now, and his eyes seemed
stern and fearless as he gave one long, steady, and withering
glance at the cowering and white-faced Hawkey Sharpe;
then he took off his coat, an example others were not slow
in following, to make as soft a couch as possible of the iron
hurdle, which four stout fellows lifted, as soon as the sufferer
was laid thereon, and the sorrowful procession, which
Hester from the window had seen approaching, set out
for Earlshaugh.
</p>

<p>
'Fules shouldna hae chappin' sticks!  I kent how it wad
be wi' some o' us,' muttered old Gavin Fowler, as he sharply
drew his cartridges, and unaware of Hawkey Sharpe's secret
motives for action, added, 'Maister Roland, he has nearly
made cauld meat o' me mair than ance; but ne'er again&mdash;ne'er
again will I beat the coveys wi' him.  It is as muckle
as your life's worth!'
</p>

<p>
Slowly the shooting party wended their way, by field and
hedgerow, towards the mansion-house; and, with his heart
full of bitter and vengeful, if vague, thoughts, Roland strode
by that blood-stained litter, thinking of the time when he
had seen Jack Elliot similarly borne from the field of
Tel-el-Kebir.
</p>

<p>
Seeing the deep commiseration of Roland, Elliot
attempted to smile, and said:
</p>

<p>
'You know, perhaps, the old Spanish proverb&mdash;that a
soldier had better smell of <i>polvora rancho de Santa Barbara</i>,
than of musk or lavender.'
</p>

<p>
'But not in this fashion, Jack, at the hands of a
blundering cad&mdash;if a blunder it was!'
</p>

<p>
The bearers had some distance to traverse, as the park
stretched for a couple of miles around them, wooded and
undulating, crossed by a broad silvery burn or stream, that
flowed through the haugh, and past the Weird Yett to the
hamlet of Earlshaugh.
</p>

<p>
Their arrival at the house elicited a shout of dismay from
Tom Trotter, whose nerves were not of the strongest order,
and consternation spread from the drawing-room to the
servants' hall and from thence to the stable court, with many
exaggerated reports of the very awkward part the obnoxious
Mr. Hawkey Sharpe&mdash;for obnoxious he was to all&mdash;had
played in the catastrophe; while the anguish of Maude, her
suspicion and her loathing of the latter, may be imagined,
as Elliot was borne past her to his rooms.
</p>

<p>
On hearing of an accident, neither Annot nor Hester had
thought of Captain Elliot.  The first dread of the former&mdash;a
selfish one, we fear, and of the latter, a purer one,
certainly&mdash;was for Roland Lindsay, who, accustomed to bloodshed,
wounds, and suffering, was to all appearance singularly cool
and collected.
</p>

<p>
'Don't be alarmed, Maudie, darling,' said he, endeavouring
to look cheerful, as he drew his terrified sister
almost forcibly aside; 'Jack will be all right in a few
days.'
</p>

<p>
'But what&mdash;oh, what has happened?'
</p>

<p>
'He has been hit&mdash;shot&mdash;wounded, I mean&mdash;that is all,
by Hawkey Sharpe, or some other duffer.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Roland, why did you have that horrid fellow to
shoot with you?  But need I ask why&mdash;we can help nothing
now!  But Jack&mdash;my darling&mdash;my darling!' she added with
a torrent of tears; 'I had a presentiment&mdash;I knew
something would happen, and it <i>has</i> happened!  Oh heavens,
Roland, our position here seems overstrained and unnatural.
Would that we were out of Earlshaugh and his power!'
</p>

<p>
'Maude?  Our father's house!'
</p>

<p>
'Our father's house no more.'
</p>

<p>
'That is as may be,' replied Roland, through his set
teeth.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the author of all this dismay ascended the
turret-stairs to his 'sanctum' and betook him without delay,
with tremulous hands and chattering teeth, to a stiff and tall
rummer of brandy and soda to steady his nerves, gather
Dutch courage, and prepare to face the worst, while
muttering as if to excuse himself.
</p>

<p>
'An insult of the sort he gave me can never be forgotten!'
and he rubbed his right ear, which seemed yet to be
conscious of Jack's finger and thumb when used by the latter
as a fulcrum to twist him round; while, to do her justice,
his sister Deborah grew paler than ever, and seemed on
the point of sinking when she heard of what had
occurred.
</p>

<p>
'It was all an accident&mdash;a horrible accident, Deb,' said
he, an assertion to which he stuck vigorously; 'my ankle
got twisted in a turnip shaw, don't you see&mdash;anyhow, don't
get up your agitation-of-the-heart business just now, for my
nerves may not stand it.'
</p>

<p>
She eyed him coldly&mdash;almost sternly, and not as she was
wont to do; she read his real fear, and knew the full value of
his sham contrition, and that it was born of alarm for
himself; but his courage rose, and his secret wrath and hate
returned apace, when the doctors, after a consultation and
much pulling of nether lips, with also much mysterious and
technical jargon, declared that the wound was not a serious
one, though some of the charge (No. 5), which had crossed
Jack's chest transversely, went perilously near the heart;
and that unless suppuration took place, his constitution was
so fine 'he would soon pull through.'
</p>

<p>
The doubt that he might <i>not</i>, or that a relapse might
ensue, proved too much just then for the nerves of
Mr. Hawkey Sharpe, who resolved on taking his departure for
a time.
</p>

<p>
'And you go&mdash;for where, Hawkey?' asked his sister, not
surprised that he should suddenly remember an engagement.
</p>

<p>
'To the western meeting&mdash;they make such a fuss over
this accident, and you know I hate fuss.  Besides, I have a
pot of money on the Welter Cup, and if I lose&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;why, the timber of that old King's Wood may
come to the hammer&mdash;that's all, Deb,' said he, as confidently
as if it were his own.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Now, girls, don't be foolish,' said Roland, in reply to the
entreaties of Maude and Hester&mdash;the former especially&mdash;to
be permitted to visit Jack, who was now abed, and in the
hands of an accredited nurse.
</p>

<p>
'Why&mdash;may not I see him?' pled Maude.
</p>

<p>
'Not yet, certainly,' replied Roland, caressing her sunny
brown hair, and patting her cheek, from which the faint rose
tint was fled.
</p>

<p>
'I must see him, Roland, that I may know he is
not&mdash;not&mdash;dead.
</p>

<p>
'Dead, you dear little goose!  Such fellows as Jack
Elliot take a long time in dying.  You should have seen him as
I did (though it is well, however, you did not), when doubled
up by a grape-shot at Tel-el-Kebir.  He'll be all right in a
day or two, and meanwhile&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'What, Roland?' asked the trembling girl.
</p>

<p>
'I go to Edinburgh, to get at the real state of our affairs,
what or however they may be; I feel inclined to shoot that
fellow Sharpe like a dog if he crosses my path again at
Earlshaugh!'
</p>

<p>
'Roland, Roland, you surely know all?' said his sister
with intense sadness.
</p>

<p>
'No, I do not know all,' said he, drawing her head on
his breast and caressing her; and feeling keenly that their
father's roof was degraded by the presence of this fellow,
after attempting such a crime&mdash;for a crime Roland felt and
knew it to be; albeit that the perpetrator was the brother of
their father's widow, and should, but for cogent reasons, be
handed over to the mercies of the Procurator-Fiscal for the
county.
</p>

<p>
By the very outrage he had committed, Sharpe had
excited all the tenderness and commiseration for Elliot of
which Maude's nature was capable, and for himself all the
loathing and detestation which her usually gentle heart could
feel.  Thus he had lost much and won nothing; and notwithstanding
his sister's position, influence, and interest at
Earlshaugh, he felt himself very much <i>de trop</i>; and, unable
to face the heavy fire of obloquy and blame that met him
on every hand, he feigned the excuse&mdash;if such were wanting&mdash;of
having to attend the Ayr races, which came off about
that time, and departed ostensibly for the great western
meeting on that famous course which lies southward of the
ancient town of Ayr.  His farewell words to his sister
were:
</p>

<p>
'I'll be even with Roland Lindsay yet&mdash;yes, more than
even, as you shall see, Deb!'
</p>

<p>
Whether he really went there was apocryphal, as he was
seen ere long hovering about the vicinity of Earlshaugh, if
not in the house itself.
</p>

<p>
And Hawkey Sharpe never did anything without a prime
or ulterior object in view.
</p>

<p>
The event we have narrated marred the partridge shooting
at Earlshaugh for a time; and as lately quite a crop of
dances and drums, garden and music parties had sprung up
in the vicinity, and attendance at these was marred too,
Annot Drummond felt more exasperation than commiseration
at the cause thereof.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><br />
THE WILL.
</h3>

<p>
In the pursuit of personal information, which should have
been in his possession before, that somewhat too easy-going
young soldier, Roland Lindsay, in the course of a day or
two, found himself in the 'Gray Metropolis of the North,'
or rather in that portion thereof which has sprung up within
the last hundred and forty years or so.
</p>

<p>
The office of Mr. M'Wadsett, W.S., was amid a number
of such 'wasps' nests,' in a small and rather gloomy and
depressing arena known as Thistle Court, under the shadow
of St. Andrew's great, sombre, and circular-shaped church.
</p>

<p>
The situation was a good one for a prosperous town
lawyer's office, and Mr. M'Wadsett was a prosperous&mdash;and,
as usual with many of them, effusively pious&mdash;lawyer, and
all about him, whether by chance or design, was arranged to
give clients&mdash;victims many deemed themselves&mdash;an impression
that his practice was wide, select, and respectable&mdash;intensely
respectable&mdash;while Mr. M'Wadsett never omitted
church services at least twice daily, for the kirk was his
fetish&mdash;the test of a decorous life, like his black suit and
white necktie.
</p>

<p>
He was busily engaged just then, so Roland sent in his
card and had to wait, which he felt as a kind of hint that he
was not so important a client now as he might have been.
The room he was ushered into was a dull one, overlooking
the gloomy court; and slowly the time seemed to pass, for
Roland was in an agony of impatience now to know the
worst&mdash;the profound folly of his father, for whom his feelings
just then were, to say the least of them, of a somewhat
mingled cast.
</p>

<p>
Mr. M'Wadsett's office consisted of several rooms&mdash;the
interior and upper floors of an old-fashioned house.  In one
of these, partly furnished like a parlour, the walls hung with
fly-blown maps and prospectuses&mdash;a waiting-room&mdash;Roland
was left to fume and 'cool his heels'; while in one somewhere
adjacent he heard a curious clashing of fire-irons, and
a voice giving the&mdash;to him&mdash;somewhat familiar words of
command, but in a suppressed tone:
</p>

<p>
'Guard&mdash;point&mdash;two!  Low guard&mdash;point&mdash;two!' etc.,
for it was evident that some of the clerks who were rifle
volunteers were having a little bayonet exercise, till a bell
rang, when they all vaulted upon their stools and began to
write intensely, for then the voice of old Mr. M'Wadsett
was heard, and Roland was ushered into his presence.
</p>

<p>
His room was snug and cosy, albeit its principal furniture
consisted of green charter boxes on iron frames, all of which
held secrets relating to the families whose well-known names
were displayed upon them.  How much, indeed, did he
not know about all the leading proprietors of Fife and
Kinross?
</p>

<p>
He received his visitor warmly and pleasantly enough,
spoke of the war in Egypt, his health, the weather, of
course, and then when a pause ensued, Roland stated the
object for which he had come.
</p>

<p>
The lawyer, a fussy little man, with a sharp, keen manner,
and sharp, keen gray eyes, raised his silver-rimmed glasses
above his bushy white eyebrows, and said:
</p>

<p>
'My dear sir, I sent a copy of your respected father's will
to Egypt.'
</p>

<p>
'Addressed to me?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'I never got it.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'We were holding the lines in front of Ramleh at that
time; the Arabs made free with the mail-bags, and lit their
pipes with the contents, no doubt, in the desert beyond
Ghizeh.'
</p>

<p>
'My dear sir, how lawless of them!'
</p>

<p>
'I have thought about this will at times, till I have
become stupid&mdash;woolly in fact, and hated the name of it.'
</p>

<p>
'Your good father&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Ah,' interrupted Roland, a little testily, 'I fear we only
looked upon him latterly as the family banker, and he was
useful in that way&mdash;very.'
</p>

<p>
'To your brother in the Guards perhaps too much so,'
said the lawyer gravely.
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;about the cursed document itself?' began Roland
a little impetuously.
</p>

<p>
'Strong language, my dear sir&mdash;strong language!  The
terms of your respected father's will are, I must say, a little
peculiar, and were framed much against my advice; though
his old family agent, I scarcely felt justified in drawing out
the document.'
</p>

<p>
'I have heard that its conditions are outrageous.'
</p>

<p>
'They are&mdash;my dear sir&mdash;they are.'
</p>

<p>
'Such as no respectable lawyer should have drawn up,'
said Roland sternly.
</p>

<p>
'Captain Lindsay, there you are wrong&mdash;severe&mdash;but I
excuse you,' replied Mr. M'Wadsett, perking up his bald,
shining head, as he drew the document in question from a
charter box, after some trouble in finding the key thereof,
and which Roland eyed&mdash;without touching it&mdash;with a very
gloomy and louring expression.
</p>

<p>
'Dear me&mdash;dear me,' muttered M'Wadsett, as, seating
himself in a well-stuffed circular chair, and adjusting his
spectacles, he glanced over the document.  'He wrote: "I
have delayed making my will so long as I have thought it
safe to do so, but I am an old man now, and the gross and
wilful extravagance of&mdash;&mdash;"  Shall I read it all, Captain
Lindsay?  The first few clauses are unimportant enough:
£1,000 to Sir Harry Maule; some jewellery to his daughter
Hester&mdash;bequests to the servants&mdash;Funnell the butler,
Buckle the head groom, and then with the provisions
appointed for your sister and yourself&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Comes the "crusher," I suppose,' interrupted Roland,
crashing his right heel on the floor.
</p>

<p>
'Precisely so, my dear sir; I don't wonder that you feel
it; but listen and I shall read it all.'
</p>

<p>
'Please don't,' cried Roland; 'lawyers make everything
so lengthy, so elaborate, so full of circumlocution and
irritating repetition.  Cut it short&mdash;the gist of it.'
</p>

<p>
'Is&mdash;that all the estates, real and personal, are devised
and bequeathed by the testator to his wife, Deborah Sharpe
or Lindsay.'
</p>

<p>
'For life?
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;to do with as she pleases in all time coming; the
whole power of willing everything away is left in her hands,
as you may read for yourself here.'
</p>

<p>
There was a silence of a minute.
</p>

<p>
'I thought such episodes&mdash;such outrages&mdash;never
happened but in novels?' said Roland.
</p>

<p>
The lawyer smiled faintly and shook his head, and
refolding the document, said:
</p>

<p>
'It is, of course, duly recorded.'
</p>

<p>
'And Earlshaugh will go to her heirs?'
</p>

<p>
'To Mr. Hawkey Sharpe, unless she devises otherwise.'
</p>

<p>
'A bitter satire!'
</p>

<p>
'A codicil was framed, or nearly so, revoking much that
had gone before; but was never signed.  By that
omission&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I have lost all,' said Roland, starting to his feet; 'so
the fortunes of the Lindsays of Earlshaugh are at their
lowest ebb.'
</p>

<p>
'Unless you can find an heiress,' said the lawyer, with
another of his weak smiles.
</p>

<p>
Annot was no heiress, Roland remembered.
</p>

<p>
'As for my father's folly,' he was beginning bitterly, when
M'Wadsett touched his arm:
</p>

<p>
'Let us not speak ill of the dead,' said he; 'the late
Laird may have been deceived, misled&mdash;let us not wrong
him.'
</p>

<p>
'But he has wronged the living, who have to feel&mdash;to
endure and to suffer!'
</p>

<p>
'The folly of your brother, the Guardsman&mdash;rather than
your own&mdash;brought all this about, Captain Lindsay,' said
the lawyer, rising too, as if the unprofitable interview had
come to an end; and, a few minutes after, Roland found
himself outside in the bustle and sunshine of George Street,
that broad, stately, and magnificent thoroughfare, along
which he wandered like one in a bad dream, and full of
vague, angry, and bitter thoughts.
</p>

<p>
A deep sense of unmerited humiliation galled his naturally
proud spirit, now that the truth of his real position had
been laid before him without doubt.
</p>

<p>
The 'fool's paradise' in which he had been partly living
had vanished; and he thought how much better it had
been had he left his bones at Tel-el-Kebir, at Kashgate,
or anywhere else in Egypt, as so many of his comrades had
done.
</p>

<p>
What was he to do now?
</p>

<p>
His profession at least was left him.  Would he return to
his regiment at once, and go to Earlshaugh no more?  It
was impossible just yet to turn his back on what was once
his home.  There was Annot, his <i>fiancée</i>; there was Maude,
his sister; there were Jack Elliot and other guests; before
them a part must be acted as yet&mdash;and then&mdash;what
then&mdash;what next?
</p>

<p>
A bitter malediction rose to his lips, but he stifled it.
</p>

<p>
Once matters were somehow smoothed over, back to the
regiment he should, of course, go, and turning his back on
Scotland for ever, try to forget the past and everything!
</p>

<p>
With incessant iteration the thought&mdash;the question&mdash;was
ever before him how to explain to Jack Elliot and Annot
Drummond that he&mdash;Roland Lindsay, deemed the heir, the
Lord of Earlshaugh and all its acres of wood and wold,
field and pasture, was little better than an outcast&mdash;admitted
there on the sufferances of the sister of that most
pitiful wretch, Hawkey Sharpe!
</p>

<p>
Viewed in every way the situation was maddening&mdash;intolerable.
With regard to Annot, he could but trust to
her love now.  Should he ask Maude or Hester to break
the matter to her gently?  No&mdash;that task must be his
own.
</p>

<p>
Most of the hopes of himself and his sister seemed to
be based on the goodwill that might be borne them by
Deborah Sharpe (how he loathed to think of her as
Mrs. Lindsay), and she, too, evidently, was inimical to them
both, and under the complete influence of her brother,
Hawkey Sharpe.
</p>

<p>
Amid the turmoil of his thoughts he did not forget to
procure as a souvenir of this wretched visit to Edinburgh a
valuable bracelet for Annot Drummond, and then took
his way&mdash;homeward he could not deem it&mdash;to Earlshaugh.
</p>

<p>
He had but one crumb of consolation, that at the last
hour his father seemed to have repented the evil he had
done him&mdash;at the last hour&mdash;but too late!
</p>

<p>
'Not always in life is it possible to unravel the mesh
which our fingers have woven,' says a writer.  'Sometimes
it is permitted to recall the lost opportunities of a few
mistaken hours; sometimes, when all too late, we would
willingly buy back with every drop of our heart's blood the
moments we have so wilfully abused, and the chances we
have so foolishly neglected.  But it is too late!'
</p>

<p>
So it was too late when Roland's father thought to amend
his fatal will.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><br />
MOLOCH.
</h3>

<p>
While Roland's mind was agitated by a nervous dread of
how to break to the ambitious little Annot&mdash;for ambitious
he knew her to be&mdash;the real state of his position and his
altered fortune, unknown to him, and in his absence, that
young lady was receiving an inkling of how matters stood,
and thus, when the time came, some trouble and pain were
saved him.
</p>

<p>
Red-eyed, and apparently inconsolable for his absence
for a single day, the 'gushing' Annot had cast her society
almost entirely upon Hester, as Maude was too much
occupied by her own thoughts and cares to give her
sympathy.
</p>

<p>
'Why has he gone, why left me so soon after we came
here?' she moaned for the twentieth time, with her golden
head reclined on Hester's shoulder.  'What shall I do
without him?' she added.
</p>

<p>
'For a few hours only.  What will you say when winter
comes or spring, and he is back in Egypt, if you think so
much of a few hours now?'
</p>

<p>
'It is very silly of me, I suppose, but I cannot help it;
but we have never been separated since&mdash;since&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'You met at Merlwood,' said Hester coldly, and annoyed
by the other's acting or childishness, she scarcely knew
which it was.  She added, 'Business has taken him to
Edinburgh.'
</p>

<p>
'Business&mdash;he never told me!  About what?'
</p>

<p>
'Something very unpleasant, I fear; but you know that a
man of property&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Hester paused, not knowing very well how to parry the
questions of Annot, who had put them to her frequently,
and for a few minutes they promenaded together the long
flowery aisles of the conservatory in silence.
</p>

<p>
Hester was so tall and straight, so proud-looking and yet
so soft and womanly, her bearing a thing of beauty in itself,
her dark velvety eyes so sensitive and sweet in expression
that anyone might wonder how Annot Drummond, with all
her fair and fairy-like loveliness, had lured Roland away
from her, yet it was so.
</p>

<p>
Now and then, oftener than she wished, there came back
unbidden to Hester's mind memories of those happy
August evenings at Merlwood, ere Annot came, when she
and Roland wandered in the leafy dingles by the Esk, by
'caverned Hawthornden' and Roslin's ruin-crowned rock;
and when these memories came she strove to stifle them, as
if they caused a pain in her heart, for such haunting
day-dreams were full of tenderness, a vanished future and a
present sense of keen disappointment.
</p>

<p>
And she remembered well, though she never sang now,
the old song he loved so well, and which went to the air of
the 'Bonnie Briar Bush':
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The visions of the buried past<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come thronging, dearer far<br />
  Than joys the present hour can give,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than present objects are.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And she felt with a sigh that her past was indeed buried
and done with.
</p>

<p>
Honest and gentle, Hester had long since felt that she
was unequal to cope with Annot Drummond, or the game
the latter played&mdash;a damsel who possessed, as a clever
female writer says, 'all the thousand and one tricks, in
short, by which an artificial woman understands how to lay
herself out for the attraction and capture of that noble
beast of prey called man;' and Annot was indeed artificial
to the tips of her tiny fingers.
</p>

<p>
'Hester,' said Annot, breaking the silence mentioned,
and following some thoughts of her own, 'have you never
had dreams&mdash;day-dreams, I mean&mdash;of being rich?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't think so.'
</p>

<p>
'Why is this?'
</p>

<p>
'Because I am quite content; and when one is so there
is no more to be desired.  As our proverb says: "Content
is nae bairn o' wealth."'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot understand your point of view,' said Annot.
'I should like gorgeous dresses&mdash;Worth's best; fine horses,
with skins like satin, and glittering harness; stately carriages,
such as we see in the parks; tall footmen, well-liveried and
well-matched; a house in Park Lane&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'And lots of poor to feed?'
</p>

<p>
'I never think of them&mdash;they can take care of themselves,
if the police don't.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Annot!'
</p>

<p>
'And I should like my wedding presents to be the
wonder of all, and duly catalogued in all the 'Society'
papers&mdash;services in exquisite silver, the épergne of silver
and gold&mdash;spoons and forks without number&mdash;ice buckets
and biscuit boxes&mdash;coffee sets in Dresden china, écru, and
gold&mdash;toilette suites in crystal and gold&mdash;Russian sables,
fans, gloves, jewels&mdash;a Cashmere shawl from the Queen, of
course&mdash;a lovely suite of diamonds and opals from the
brother-officers of the bridegroom&mdash;shoals of letters of
congratulation, and a present with each!'
</p>

<p>
'In all this you say nothing of love,' said Hester, with a
curl on her sweet red lip, 'and without it all these things
were worthless.'
</p>

<p>
'And without them it were useless,' replied the mercenary
little beauty, with a perfect coolness that kindled an emotion
of something akin to contempt rather than amusement in
the breast of Hester.
</p>

<p>
'As Claude Melnotte says, after describing his palace by
the Lake of Como, "Dost like the picture?"' asked Annot
laughingly.
</p>

<p>
'Not at all from your point of view,' replied Hester, a
little wearily.  'The diamond and opal suite, to be the gift
of the bridegroom's brother-officers, has reference, I
suppose&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'To Roland, of course.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor Roland!' said Hester, with a genuine sigh.
</p>

<p>
'Why do you adopt that tone in regard to him?' asked
Annot, her eyes of bright hazel green dilating with surprise.
</p>

<p>
'For reasons of which, I fear, you know nothing,' replied
Hester, unable to repress a growing repugnance for the
questioner.
</p>

<p>
'But I surely must know them in time?'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'There is no "perhaps" in the matter,' said Annot
pettishly; 'what do you mean, Hester&mdash;speak?'
</p>

<p>
'Is it possible,' said the other with extreme reluctance,
'that you have never heard of the terms of his father's
will?'
</p>

<p>
'Scotch-like, you reply to one question by another.  Well,
what will?'
</p>

<p>
'His father's most singular and unjust one.'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'Not even from Roland?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;never, I say!'
</p>

<p>
'Most strange!'
</p>

<p>
'You know that I cannot speak of it.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course not.'
</p>

<p>
'But mamma may.  This estate of Earlshaugh&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Is the property by gift of his father to his second
wife&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'That grim woman, Deborah Sharpe?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;to have and to hold&mdash;I don't know the exact terms.'
</p>

<p>
'How should you?' said Annot incredulously.  'You
cannot be much of a lawyer, Hester!'
</p>

<p>
'Of course not&mdash;but this is not a lawyer's question now.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'The will is an accomplished fact.  Roland, when abroad,
may have been misled&mdash;nay, has been misled&mdash;by words
and delusive hopes; but these the family agent will shatter
when he shows him the truth.'
</p>

<p>
Annot made no immediate reply to a startling statement,
which she suspected was merely the outcome of natural
female jealousy, and perhaps rancour in the heart of Hester
Maule.  But the memory of the latter went too distinctly
back to that mournful day at Earlshaugh when the last laird
had been borne to his last home on the shoulders of his
serving men, while Roland was in Egypt, and poor Maude
too ill to leave her own room; the solemn and substantial
luncheon that was laid in the dining-hall for all who attended
the funeral, and of the subsequent reading of the will by
Mr. M'Wadsett in the Red Drawing-room to that listening group,
over whom lay the hush and the shadow of selfish anticipation;
the legacies to faithful old servants, those to her
father, to herself, and other relations; and then the terrible
clause which bequeathed to 'his well-beloved wife and
ministering angel of his later days' everything else of which
the testator died possessed.  And then followed the buzz
of astonishment and dissatisfaction with which the sombre
assembly broke up.
</p>

<p>
Of these details Hester said nothing to Annot; but the
latter had now something <i>to reflect upon</i>, which was too
distasteful for consideration, and which she endeavoured
resolutely to set aside.
</p>

<p>
Sooth to say, her selfish delight in the solid, luxurious,
and baronial glories of Earlshaugh was too great to be easily
dissipated, and she had still, as ever, a decided, repugnance
to the recollections of her widowed mother's struggles with
limited means; and their somewhat sordid home in South
Belgravia, as she sought courageously to shut her bright eyes
to the gruesome probabilities of Hester's communication.
</p>

<p>
With a sigh of sorrow, in which, notwithstanding the
gentleness of her nature, much of contempt was mingled,
Hester Maule regarded her town-bred cousin, who though
apparently so volatile and thoughtless, was quite a watchful
little woman of the world, with what seemed childish ways,
and Hebe-like beauty, so fair, so soft, with rose-leaf
complexion, and her <i>petite</i> face peeping forth, as it were, from
among the coils and masses of her wonderful golden hair;
and yet she was ever ready to sacrifice everything to
society&mdash;that Moloch to which so many now sacrifice purity,
happiness, and life itself.
</p>

<p>
For Annot believed in a union of hands and lands, with
hearts left out of the compact.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><br />
ANNOT'S MISGIVINGS.
</h3>

<p>
Jack Elliot's mishap&mdash;accident though it could scarcely be
called&mdash;thoroughly marred and shortened the partridge
shooting at Earlshaugh, and the birds had quite a holiday
of it.
</p>

<p>
'Never mind, Jack,' Roland had said on his departure for
Edinburgh, 'you'll make amends when the pheasants are
ready.'
</p>

<p>
Irritated by the event which had struck him down&mdash;exasperated
by the whole affair, the secret motives for which had
gradually become more apparent to him, Elliot tossed on his
bed feverishly and wearily, at times scarcely conscious, in a
sleepy trance, for he had lost much blood; but being a
tough fellow, with a splendid constitution, he soon became
convalescent, after the few grains of No. 5 that lodged had
been picked out by the doctors.
</p>

<p>
Feverishly he called for cooling draughts, which were
always at hand, prepared by old Mrs. Drugget, the buxom
housekeeper, and even by grim, grave Mrs. Lindsay, whom
the catastrophe had seriously startled and upset, as it showed
the cruelty, cunning, and devilish villany of which her
brother and <i>protégé</i> was capable.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Drugget, influenced by Jack's love of Maude, whom
she had known from infancy, scarcely left the patient for an
instant, and ever sat motionless and watchful by his bedside,
till he was safe, and in the way of a rapid recovery.
</p>

<p>
Many were the calls to know the progress of the invalid,
whose 'accident' had made some noise and excited much
speculation; carriages were always rolling up to the <i>porte-cochère</i>,
the great iron bell of which was clanged incessantly,
and on the same errand horsemen came cantering across the
park; and one thing seemed certain, that, until the party
then assembled at Earlshaugh left the place, Mr. Hawkey
Sharpe would not show himself there in the field, nor under
the roof of the house, it was confidently supposed.
</p>

<p>
Ere long Elliot was promoted from jellies and beef-tea to
chicken and champagne, administered by the loving little
white hands of Maude; and, with such a nurse, it seemed
not a bad thing to lie convalescent to one like Jack, who had
undergone enteric fever in the hospital at Ismailia, by the
Lake of Tismah, and later still in the huts at Quarantine
Island, by the burning shore of Suakim.
</p>

<p>
Maude grew bright and merry; she had got over the
shock; but yet had in her heart all the terror and loathing
it could feel for the hand that had dealt the injury&mdash;an
injury which, but for the scandal it must have caused in the
county generally, and in the 'East Neuk' in particular,
might have been made a very serious matter for Mr. Hawkey
Sharpe.
</p>

<p>
Actuated by some judicious remarks from the old Writer
to the Signet of Thistle Court, Roland returned to Earlshaugh
with the intention of endeavouring to 'tide over' the
humiliation and difficulties of his position till he could turn
his back upon that place for ever, without making any more
unpleasantness, and, more than all, giving rise to any useless
speculation or <i>esclandre</i>.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Lindsay had somehow heard of his sudden, but
certainly not unexpected, visit to Edinburgh, and divined its
object, if indeed no casual rumour had reached her about
it; and a smile of derision and triumph, that would greatly
have pleased her obnoxious brother, stole over her pale and
usually calm face when she thought of the utter futility of
Roland's expedition; and something of this emotion in her
eyes was the response to his somewhat crest-fallen aspect
when she met him in the Red Drawing-room on his
return.
</p>

<p>
But he was master of himself, if he was master of nothing
more, and resolved to have a truce, if not a treaty of peace,
with 'Deborah Sharpe,' as he and Maude always called her
in her absence.
</p>

<p>
Strange to say, he found that, outwardly at least, her old
animosity, jealousy, and spirit of defiance were much
lessened, though he knew not the secret cause thereof; but
she was a woman, and as he looked on the deathly pallor
of her face, the ill-concealed agitation of her manner, and
thought of the terrible secret disease under which she
laboured, he felt something of pity for her, that was for the
time both genuine and generous.
</p>

<p>
'You look pale,' said he gently as he took her hand and
led her to a sofa, adjusting a cushion at her back; 'I hope
you have not been exciting yourself about the state of my
friend Elliot; Jack will be all right in a few days now.'
</p>

<p>
The soft grace of his manner and sweetness of his tone
(common to him when addressing all women) impressed her
greatly; her own brother, Hawkey Sharpe, never spoke
thus, even when seeking his incessant monetary favours.
If the latter watched her pallor or detected illness, his
observation was rendered acute, not by fraternal tenderness,
but by selfishness and ulterior views of his own; thus
Roland's bearing vanquished, for a time at least, her innate
dislike of him, for it is an idiosyncrasy in the hearts of
many to dislike and fear those they have wronged or
supplanted.
</p>

<p>
Thus Roland was superior to her.
</p>

<p>
'A more glorious victory cannot be gained over another
than this,' says Tillotson; 'when the injury began on their
part, the kindness should begin on ours.'
</p>

<p>
'I hope you have secured medical advice as to the state
of your health?' said he after a little pause, and with a
nameless courtesy in his attitude.
</p>

<p>
'Thank you so much for your kindness, Roland.'  (She
usually called him 'Captain Lindsay.')  'Just now you
remind me so much of your father; and this is the anniversary
of the day when he met with his terrible accident, and
his horse threw him,' she added, looking not at him, but
past him; yet the woman's usually hard disposition was
suddenly moved by the touch of nature that 'makes the
whole world kin.'
</p>

<p>
'Like my father, you think?' said Roland coldly.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;and for <i>his</i> sake it is perhaps not too late&mdash;too
late&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'For what?' he asked, as her lip quivered and she
paused.
</p>

<p>
'Time will show,' she replied, as one of her spasms
made her lip quiver again, and her breath came short and
heavily.
</p>

<p>
'Is there anything Maude or I can do for you&mdash;speak,
please?' said Roland, starting up.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing&mdash;but do give me your arm to the door of my
own room, and ring for Mrs. Drugget.'
</p>

<p>
He gave her his escort tenderly and courteously; and
thus ended a brief interview&mdash;the first pleasant one he had
ever had with 'the usurper' of his patrimony, and which he
was to recall at a future time.
</p>

<p>
Whether or not Annot Drummond was thinking over
Hester's cloudy and alarming communications it is difficult
to say; but she said to the latter after a most effusive
meeting with her <i>fiancé</i>:
</p>

<p>
'What <i>has</i> come over Roland since his visit to Edinburgh?
He looks shockingly ill&mdash;so changed&mdash;so <i>triste</i>&mdash;what
does it all mean?'
</p>

<p>
'I told you he went there on business, and that seems to
have always its worries&mdash;all the greater, perhaps, to those
who detest or know nothing about it.'
</p>

<p>
'His moodiness quite belies the sobriquet of his
name&mdash;"The Lindsays lightsome and gay;" but here he comes
again.  Roland,' she added, springing up and kissing his
cheek, 'a thousand thanks, darling, for this lovely bracelet
you have brought me.  It was so kind&mdash;so like you to
remember poor little me!'
</p>

<p>
'As if I could, even for a moment, forget,' was his
half-maudlin response, while she drew up her sleeve a little
way, coquetishly displaying a lovely arm of snowy whiteness,
firmly and roundly moulded by perfect health and
youth, with the bracelet clasped on her slender wrist; and
while turning it round and round, so as to inspect it in
every light and from every point of view, she was thinking
that when&mdash;after the bestowal of so many other valuable
gifts&mdash;he could bring her a jewel so expensive as this, surely
Hester's hints about <i>the will</i> must have been nonsense, or
the outcome of jealousy at her&mdash;Annot's&mdash;success with a
handsome cousin, whom she knew that Hester was at least
well disposed to regard with interest.
</p>

<p>
Yet, when she and Roland were together, to Annot's
watchful eyes his manner did seem thoughtful and absent
at times, and would have caused misgivings but that she
thought, and flattered herself, that it was caused, perhaps,
by his having to go prematurely to Egypt, like Malcolm
Skene.
</p>

<p>
After Elliot had become convalescent, and Roland, with
others, had resumed their guns, and betaken them again to
the slaughter of the partridges, all went well apparently for a
few weeks.  There were gay riding parties in the afternoon
to visit the ruined castles at Ceres and the muir where
Archbishop Sharpe was slain; to the caves of Dura Den
at Kemback; picnics to Creich and the hills of Logie;
there were dances in the evening, and music, when Hester's
rich contralto, Elliot's tenor, Maude's soft soprano, and
Roland's bass, took principal parts.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Young hearts, bright eyes, and rosy lips were there;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fairy steps, and light and laughing voices<br />
  Ringing like welcome music through the air&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sound at which the untroubled heart rejoices.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Life seemed a happy idyl, and that of Annot&mdash;we must
suppose that she had her special dreams of happiness
too&mdash;was ever gay apparently; but Roland's soul was secretly
steeped in misery!
</p>

<p>
Circumstanced as he knew himself to be, Annot's frequent
praises of Earlshaugh and her delight with all therein galled
and fretted him, and made him so strange in manner at
times that the girl, to do her justice, was bewildered and
grieved; and Hester, though she wished it not nor thought
of it, was in some degree avenged.
</p>

<p>
'What can be the meaning of it?' was often Annot's
secret thought.
</p>

<p>
Like Elliot and Maude, to her it seemed that perhaps
they were too happy for commonplace speeches as they idled
hand-in-hand about the grounds, wandering through vistas
of thick and venerable hawthorn-hedges, away by the
thatched hamlet, through the wooded haugh, where the
'auld brig-stane' still spanned the wimpling burn, while
face turned to radiant face, and loving eye met eye.
</p>

<p>
In such moments what need had they, she thought, for
words that might seem dull or clumsy?  'But, after all,
words, though coarse or clumsy, are the coin in which
human creatures must pay each other, and failing in which
they are often bankrupts for life.'
</p>

<p>
Had Roland spoken then and said much that he left
unsaid, perhaps much suffering might have been spared him
at a future time&mdash;we says 'perhaps,' but not with certainty,
as we have only our story to tell, without indulging in
casuistry as to what might have occurred in the sequel.
</p>

<p>
The story of the will, Annot began to think, must have
been a fallacy&mdash;a cruel and unpalatable one.  By-and-by
she refused to face the probability at all; but she could not
help remarking that when their conversation insensibly
turned upon the future, as that of lovers must do, upon
their probable trip to London, his certain tour of service in
Egypt, or on anything that lay beyond the sunny horizon
of the <i>present</i>, Roland became strange in manner, abrupt
and cloudy, and nervously sought to turn the subject into
another channel.
</p>

<p>
Could he tell her yet, that he was a kind of outcast in
the house of his forefathers; that he was a mere visitor at
Earlshaugh, and that not a foot of the soil he trod was his
own?
</p>

<p>
And so day by day and night after night went on.  The
riding lessons through which Annot hoped sometime to
shine in 'The Lady's Mile,' were still continued, on the
beautiful and graceful pad which old Johnnie Buckle had
procured for her at Cupar fair&mdash;tasks requiring at Roland's
hand much adjustment of flowing skirts and loose reins; of
a dainty foot in a tiny stirrup of bright steel; the buttoning
of pretty gauntlets; much pressure of lingering fingers, and
joyous laughter in the sunny and grassy parks, where now
the deers' antlers were still lying, though one tradition avers
that stags bury their horns in the moss after casting them,
and another that they chew and eat them&mdash;a practice which
Gavin Fowler and the forester asserted they had often seen
them attempt.
</p>

<p>
'And in all your stately old home there is not even one
traditional ghost?' said Annot, looking back from the
spacious lawn to where the lofty façade of the ancient
fortalice towered up on its rock in the red autumnal sunshine.
</p>

<p>
'A ghost there is, or used to be in my grandmother's
time, at the Weird Yett,' replied Roland; 'but in the house,
thank Heaven, no&mdash;though there are bits about it eerie
enough to scare the housemaids after dark without that
dismal adjunct; yet blood enough and to spare has been
shed in and about Earlshaugh often in the olden time; and
more than one ancestor of mine has ridden forth to die on
the battlefield or at Edinburgh Cross, for the Stuart kings.
But let us drop this subject, Annot; a fellow cuts a poor
figure swaggering about his ancestors and their belongings
in these days, when even every Cockney cad airs his
imaginary bit of heraldry on his notepaper.'
</p>

<p>
'But there were fairies surely in the Fairy Den?' persisted
Annot.
</p>

<p>
'But never with golden hair like yours, Annot,' said
Roland, laughing now.  'Tradition has it that an ancestor
of mine, who was Master of the Horse to Anne of Denmark,
made a friend of an old Elf who dwelt in the glen&mdash;a droll
little fellow with a huge head, a great ruff, and a gray beard
that reached to his knees&mdash;and when the then Laird of
Earlshaugh, after being caught in a flirtation with the Queen
in Falkland Wood, was about to be led to the scaffold for
his pretended share in the Gowrie Conspiracy, the Elf came
on a white palfrey and bore him away, through crowd and
soldiers and all, from the Heading Hill of Stirling to his
own woods of Earlshaugh, a story which Sir Walter Scott
assigns to another family, I believe.'
</p>

<p>
So Annot strove with success in partially abandoning herself
to the joy of the present, and to the full budding hope
of the future.
</p>

<p>
She could not bring herself, 'little woman of the world,'
as Hester knew her to be, to do or say anything that could
have the aspect of a wish on her part to hurry on a marriage
before Roland departed to Egypt; but, while trembling at
all the contingencies thereby involved, had to content herself
by prettily and coquettishly referring from time to time
to the events of their future life together and combined;
consoling herself with the knowledge that so far as Roland's
honour went, and that of his family, 'an engagement known
to all the world is much more difficult to break than one to
which only three or four persons are privy;' whilst for
herself, she adopted the tone of being, in her correspondence
with London friends, vague and cloudy, as if the engagement
might or might not be; or that her visit to Earlshaugh
meant nothing at all, more than one anywhere else.
</p>

<p>
'Now that Jack is nearly quite well,' said Maude to her,
'we are to have all manner of festivities before the pheasant
shooting is over, and we all bid adieu to dear old Earlshaugh,
Roland says.  There will be a ball, the Hunt Ball,
a steeplechase is also talked of, and I know not what
more.'
</p>

<p>
But ere these things came to pass there occurred a
catastrophe which none at Earlshaugh could foresee, that of
which, to his profound concern and bewilderment, Malcolm
Skene read in the papers at Pietro Girolamo's roulette saloon,
at Cairo.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br /><br />
THE FIRST OF OCTOBER.
</h3>

<p>
'As weel try to sup soor dook wi' an elshin as shoot in
comfort wi' that coofor waur&mdash;that gowk Hawkey Sharpe&mdash;so
thank gudeness he's no wi' us this day!' snorted old
Gavin Fowler, the gamekeeper, when, on the morning of
the all-important 1st of October, he shouldered his gun and
whistled forth the dogs.
</p>

<p>
But Hawkey Sharpe was fated to be cognisant of one
grim feature in that day's sport in a way none knew save
himself.
</p>

<p>
So October had come&mdash;'the time,' says Colonel Hawker,
'when the farmer has leisure to enjoy a little sport after all
his hard labour without neglecting his business; and the
gentleman, by a day's shooting at that time, becomes
refreshed and invigorated, instead of wearing out himself
and his dogs by slaving after partridges under the broiling
sun of the preceding month.  The evenings begin to close,
and he then enjoys his home and fireside, after a day's
shooting of sufficient duration to brace his nerves and make
everything agreeable.'
</p>

<p>
'We'll make good bags to-day,' was the opinion of all.
</p>

<p>
Despite Maude's entreaties, Jack Elliot was too keen a
sportsman to forego the first day of the pheasant shooting,
though his scar was scarcely healed, and thought, though he
did not say so to her, that next October might see him
'potting' a darker kind of game in the Soudan.
</p>

<p>
'Get me a golden pheasant's wing for my hat, dear
Roland,' said Annot laughingly, as he came forth with his
favourite breechloader from the gun-room; and though such
birds were scarce in the East Neuk, the request proved
somewhat of a fatal one, as we shall show; but Annot had
no foreboding of that when, with her usual childish effusiveness,
she bade Roland farewell, as he went to join the group
of sportsmen and dogs at the <i>porte-cochère</i>.
</p>

<p>
'You have no father, I believe, Miss Drummond?' said
Mrs. Lindsay, who had been observing her.
</p>

<p>
'No; poor papa died quite suddenly about two years
ago,' was the reply.
</p>

<p>
'Suddenly?' queried Mrs. Lindsay, becoming interested.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said Annot hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
'In what way&mdash;by an accident?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, dear&mdash;no.'
</p>

<p>
'How then?'
</p>

<p>
'Of disease of the heart; we never suspected it, but he
dropped down dead&mdash;quite dead&mdash;while poor mamma was
speaking to him about a drive in the park&mdash;but oh! what
have I said to startle you so?' she added, on perceiving
that Mrs. Lindsay grew pale as ashes, and half closing her
eyes, pressed her hand upon her left breast, a custom she
had when excited.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;only a faintness,' she said, with
something of irritation; 'it is the wind without.'
</p>

<p>
'But there is none,' urged Annot.
</p>

<p>
'I often feel this when stormy weather is at hand,' replied
the other with an attempt at a smile, but a ghastly one; and
Annot said no more, as she had already seen that the
slightest reference to her secret ailment irritated
Mrs. Lindsay, who abruptly left her.
</p>

<p>
'There is not much liking lost between us,' thought the
young lady, as she adjusted in the breast of her morning
dress a bunch of stephanotis Roland had given her.  'It is
evident, too, that Mrs. Lindsay knows little of county
society, and is one with whom county society is shy of
associating.  Well, well; when Roland and I are married, this
grim matron shall be relegated from Earlshaugh to the
Dower House at King's Wood.  It is a pity we shall not be
able to send her farther off.'
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the sportsmen were getting to work, and the
guns began to bang in the coverts.
</p>

<p>
Autumn was rapidly advancing now; every portion of the
beautiful landscape told the eye so.  The summer look was
gone, and the sound of the leaves fluttering down was apt to
make one thoughtful.  Then even the sun seems older; he
rises later, and goes to bed earlier.  The singing birds had
gone from the King's Wood and the Earl's Haugh to warmer
climes.  The swallows were preparing to leave, assembling
at their own places on the banks of the burn, waiting till
thousands mustered for their mysterious southern flight.
Elsewhere, as Clare has it, might be seen&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The hedger stopping gaps, amid the leaves,<br />
  Which time o'erhead in every colour weaves;<br />
  The milkmaid passing, with a timid look,<br />
  From stone to stone across the brimming brook;<br />
  The cottar journeying with his noisy swine<br />
  Along the wood side, where the branches twine;<br />
  Shaking from many oaks the acorns brown,<br />
  Or from the hedges red haws dashing down.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But the scenery was lost on the sportsmen, who had eyes
and ears for the pheasants alone!
</p>

<p>
The keepers and beaters were waiting at the corner of the
King's Wood when Roland and his friends made their
appearance.
</p>

<p>
Though the copses had not lost all their autumnal glory,
the season was an advanced one; a cold breeze swept
down the grassy glens, and frost rime hung for a time on
boughs and thick undergrowth, sparkling like diamonds in
the bright morning sunshine, till melted away; and in the
clear air was heard that which someone describes as the
indescribable and never-to-be-forgotten sound for the
sportsman&mdash;that of the pheasant as he rises before the advancing
line of beaters&mdash;when the cock bird, roused by the tapping
of their sticks on the tree trunks, whirrs high over the tops
to some sanctuary in the wood, which the gun beneath him
fates him never to reach.
</p>

<p>
A spirt of smoke spouts upward, some brown feathers
puff out in the air, and with closed wings the beautiful bird
falls within some thirty yards of its killer.
</p>

<p>
Though the shooting was most successful, other coverts
than the King's Wood were tried, some of which gave
pheasants, others rabbits and hares, till fairly good bags
were made; and so the sportsmen shot down the side of a
remote spur of the Ochil hills&mdash;save the banging of the
guns no other sounds being heard but the beating of sticks
against trees or whin bushes, and the voices of Gavin and
the beaters shouting, 'Mark cock,' ''Ware hen,' 'Hare
forward,' and so on, till a dark dell was reached&mdash;a regular
zeriba (Roland called it) of bracken, briars, and
gorse&mdash;where luncheon was to meet the party&mdash;one of the not
least pleasant features of a day's shooting; but the
sportsmen had become so intent on their work that they now
realized fully for the first time that the day had become
overcast; masses of dark gathered cloud had enveloped the
sun; that dense gray mist was rolling along the upper slopes
of the hills, and in the distant direction of Earlshaugh, the
dark and blurred horizon showed that rain was pouring
aslant, and so heavily that Maude and Hester, who had
promised to bring the viands in the pony phaeton, would
not dream of leaving the shelter of the house.
</p>

<p>
'Homeward' was now the word, but not before the last
beat of the day&mdash;reserved as a <i>bonne bouche</i>&mdash;was made,
though noon was past and gloom was gathering speedily.
</p>

<p>
At the upper end of a little glen a long belt of firs
bounded a field beyond which rose another belt, and in the
field the guns were posted, while the pheasants could be
seen making for the head of the wood.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and more near came the tapping of the beaters'
rods, until one gallant bird rose at the edge and was
knocked over by Roland, who was far away on the extreme
right of the line.  The tapping went gently on lest too
many birds should be put up at once.  Some rapid firing
followed&mdash;all the more rapidly that the mist and rain were
coming down the hill-slopes together.
</p>

<p>
In quick succession the birds left the covert, some flying
to one flank, some to the other, while others rose high in
the air, and some remained grovelling amid the undergrowth,
never to leave it alive.
</p>

<p>
It was no slaughter&mdash;no <i>battue</i>&mdash;however; about a dozen
brace were knocked over and picked up ere the mist
descended over the field and its boundary belts of fir trees,
and drawing their cartridges, in twos and threes, with their
guns under their arms and their coat collars up, for the rain
was falling now, the sportsmen began to take their way
back towards the house, which was then some miles distant:
and all reached it, in the gathering gloom of a prematurely
early evening&mdash;weary, worn, yet in high spirits, and&mdash;save for
the contents of their flasks&mdash;unrefreshed, when they
discovered that Roland Lindsay was <i>not</i> with them&mdash;that in
some unaccountable way they had, somehow, lost or missed
him on the mountain side.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap29"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX.
<br /><br />
ALARM AND ANXIETY.
</h3>

<p>
Time passed on&mdash;the mist and rain deepened around
Earlshaugh, veiling coppice, glen, and field, and Roland did
not appear.
</p>

<p>
He must have lost his way; but then every foot of the
ground was so familiar to him that such seemed impossible;
and the idea of an accident did not as yet occur to any
one.
</p>

<p>
Thus none waited for him at the late luncheon table, and
then, as in the smoke-room and over the billiard balls, Jack
Elliot and others talked only of the events of the day&mdash;how
the birds were flushed and knocked over&mdash;of hits and
misses, of game clean-killed, and so forth; how one
gorgeous old pheasant in particular came crashing down
through the wiry branches of the dark firs in the agonies of
death; and how deftly Roland killed his game, without
requiring a keeper to give the <i>coup de grâce</i>&mdash;there were
never many runners before him, and how 'he looked as
fresh as a daisy after doing the ninety acre copse,' and so
forth, till his protracted absence and the closing in of the
darkness, with the ringing of the dressing-bell for dinner,
made all conscious of the time, and led them to wonder
"what on earth" had become of him&mdash;what had happened,
and whither had he, or could he have gone!
</p>

<p>
Speculations were many and endless,
</p>

<p>
'Some fatality seems surely to attend the shooting here
now!' said Mrs. Lindsay anxiously, as she nervously pressed
her large white, ringed hands together.
</p>

<p>
To some of those present the stately dinner, served up in
the lofty old dining-room, was a kind of mockery; and
Maude and Hester, who dreaded they knew not what,
made but a pretence of eating, while the presence of the
servants proved a wholesome, if galling, restraint to them;
but not so to the irrepressible Annot, who talked away as
usual to the gentlemen present, and displayed all her pretty
little tricks of manner as if no cause for surmise or anxiety
was on the tapis.
</p>

<p>
The unusual pallor, silence, and abstraction of Mrs. Lindsay,
as she sat at the head of the table, while Jack
Elliot officiated as host, were painfully apparent to those
who, like Hester, watched her.
</p>

<p>
But she had her own secret thoughts, in which none, as
yet, shared!
</p>

<p>
An attempt had been made to injure Elliot, perhaps
mortally, under cover of a blunder&mdash;a mishap.  Had the
same evil hand been at work again?
</p>

<p>
A cloud there was no dispelling began to settle over all;
conversation became broken, disjointed, overstrained, and
the cloud seemed deeper as a rising storm howled round the
lofty old house, shook the wet ivy against the windows, and
grew in force with the gathering gloom of night.
</p>

<p>
Annot's equanimity amid these influences grieved Maude
and annoyed Hester, who recalled her twaddling grief when
Roland had been but a few hours absent from her in Edinburgh.
</p>

<p>
'How can she bear herself so?' said Maude.
</p>

<p>
'Because she is heartless,' replied Hester; 'and to say
the least of her, I never could imagine Annot, with all her
prettiness and <i>espièglerie</i>, at the head of a household, or
taking her place in society like a woman of sense.'
</p>

<p>
Hour succeeded hour, and still there was no appearance
of Roland, and the clang of the great iron bell in the
<i>porte-cochère</i> was listened for in vain.
</p>

<p>
So the night came undoubtedly on, but what a night it
proved to be of storm and darkness!
</p>

<p>
The rain hissed on the swaying branches of the great trees
now almost stripped and bare; it tore down the flowers from
the rocks on which the house stood, and wrenched away the
matted ivy from turret and chimney; the green turf of the
lawn and meadows was soaked till it became a kind of bog;
the winding walks that descended to the old fortalice became
miniature cascades that shone through the gloom, while the
wind wailed in the machicolations of the upper walls in
weird and solemn gusts, to die away down the haugh
below.
</p>

<p>
That a tempest had been coming some of the older people
about the place, like Gavin Fowler, had foretold, as that
loud and hollow noise like distant thunder that often
precedes a storm among the Scottish mountains had been heard
among the spurs of the Ochils, and from which in the
regions farther North, the superstitious Highlanders, as
General Stewart tells, presage many omens, when 'the Spirit
of the Mountain shrieks.'
</p>

<p>
All night long the house-bell was clanged at intervals from
the bartizan, to the alarm of the neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
London-bred Annot was scared at last by the elemental
war, by these strange sounds, and the pale faces of those
about her, and with blanched visage she peered from the
deeply embayed windows into the darkness without, with
genuine alarm, now.
</p>

<p>
How often had she and Roland rambled in yonder green
park, not a vestige of which could now be seen even
between the flying glimpses of the moon, or crossed it
together, talking of and planning out that future which he
seemed to approach with such doubt and diffidence latterly;
or as he went forth with his breechloader on his shoulder
and she clinging with interlaced hands on his right arm&mdash;he
tall, strong, and stalwart, with his dogs at his heels, and
looking down lovingly and trustfully into her fair, smiling
face.
</p>

<p>
Now they might never there and thus walk again, yet her
tears seemed to be lodged very deep just then.
</p>

<p>
But softer Hester's thoughts were more acute.  Had
Roland perished in some unforeseen, mysterious, and terrible
manner?  Was this the last of <i>her</i> secret love-dream, and
had all hope, sweetness, glamour and beauty gone out of her
heart&mdash;out of her life altogether?
</p>

<p>
Oh, what had happened?
</p>

<p>
Could Hawkey Sharpe&mdash;no, she thrust even fear of him
on one side; but, as the time stole on and the midnight
hour passed without tidings, she tortured herself with
questions, lay down without undressing, and wetted her pillow
with tears for the doubly lost companion of her infancy, of
her girlhood, and its riper years&mdash;thinking all the while that
her sorrow, her longing, and passionate terrors were for the
affianced of another&mdash;of the artful Annot Drummond.
</p>

<p>
Clinging to the supposition that he must have mistaken
his way in the swiftly descending mist, Jack Elliot and other
guests, with serving-men, keepers, and hunters, carrying
lanterns and poles, set out more than once into the darkness,
rack, and storm to search without avail, and to return wet
and weary.
</p>

<p>
Hour after hour the circle at Earlshaugh watched and
waited, trembling at every gust and listening to every
sound&mdash;shaken and weakened by a suspense that grew intolerable.
</p>

<p>
From the windows nothing could be seen&mdash;not even the
tossing trees close by, or the dark outline of the distant
mountains.  The listeners' hearts beat quick&mdash;gust after
gust swept past, but brought no welcome sound with it, and
they became familiarized with the idea that some catastrophe
must have happened or tidings of the absent must have
come by that time; and with each returning party of
searchers, hope grew less and less, while those most vitally
concerned in the absence of Roland began to shrink from
questioning or consulting them, as they were already too
much disposed by their nature to adopt the gloomiest and
most morbid views; and still the storm gusts continued to
shake the windows, and dash against them showers of leaves
and the wet masses of overhanging foliage.
</p>

<p>
Without his cheerful presence and general <i>bonhomie</i> of
manner, how empty and void the great old drawing-room&mdash;yea,
the house itself&mdash;seemed now!  All his occasional
strange, abstracted, and thoughtful moods were forgotten,
and now the hours of the dark autumnal morning wore
inexorably on.
</p>

<p>
A few of the guests had retired to their rooms, but the
majority passed the time on easy-chairs, watching and
waiting for what might transpire.  Now and then a dog whined
mournfully, and cocked its ears as if to listen, adding to the
eerie nature of the vigil.
</p>

<p>
'Three,' said Hester to Maude when the clocks were
heard striking.  Then followed 'four' and 'five.'  The fires
were made up anew.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, my God, what <i>can</i> have happened!' thought the two
girls in their hearts, glancing at Annot, who, overcome by
weariness, had dropped into a profound sleep; and ere long
the red rays of the sun, as he rose from his bed in the
German Sea, began to tinge the summits of the distant
Ochils and the nearer Lomonds, and the storm was dying
fast away.
</p>

<p>
It was impossible now to suppose that he could in any
manner have lost himself, or taken shelter in the house of
any friend or tenant, as no message came from him, and the
last idea was completely dissipated by the final return of
Gavin Fowler, who, with his staff of keepers and beaters, had
been at every farm and house within miles making inquiries,
but in vain.
</p>

<p>
Nothing had been seen or heard of the lost one.
</p>

<p>
Gavin, however, had seen something which, though he
spoke not of it then, had given him cause for anxious
thought and much speculation.  This was Mr. Hawkey
Sharpe (who for some time past had betaken him elsewhere)
rapidly and furtively passing out by the Weird Yett, well
muffled up, either to conceal his face or for warmth against
the cold morning air; and by the path he had taken, he had
evidently come by the back private door from the house of
Earlshaugh!
</p>

<p>
'What's i' the wind noo?' muttered the old gamekeeper,
with a glare in his dark gray eye, and with knitted brows,
'But there's nae hawk, Maister Hawkey Sharpe, flees sae
high but he will fa' to some lure.  They were gey scant o'
bairns that brocht you up.'

CHAPTER XXX.
</h3>

<h3>
THE KELPIE'S CLEUGH.
</h3>

<p>
On the extreme flank of his party, and rather farther out or
off than usual, Roland, intent on following his game, took
no heed at first of the swiftly down-coming mist, till it fell
like a curtain between him and his companions, who had
drawn their cartridges and ceased firing.  Even the sound
of their voices was muffled by the density of the atmosphere
and he knew not where they were; but, thinking the cloud
would lift, he felt not the least concern, but went forward, as
he conceived, in the direction of home, and that which led
towards the field where the last beat of the day had been
made; but as he proceeded the ground seemed less and
less familiar to him.
</p>

<p>
Over a high bank, slippery with dead leaves and the
thawed rime of the past morning, he went, a nasty place to
get across, and in doing so he prudently removed the
cartridges from his gun, lest he might slip, trip, or stumble to
the detriment of himself or some adjacent companion.
</p>

<p>
Pausing at times, he uttered a hallo, but got no response.
He could see nothing of the belts of firs before referred to;
but he came upon clumps of hazel, nearly destitute of leaves,
growing thickly about the roots, and expanding as they rose
some nine feet or so above the ground.
</p>

<p>
There was a dense undergrowth of bracken and intertwisted
brambles here, a tangle of dead leaves, stems, and thorns,
most perplexing to find one's self among in a dense mist.
From amid these a rabbit or hare scudded forth; but he
took no heed of it.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a bird&mdash;a fine golden pheasant&mdash;whirred up,
and settled down again in the covert very near him.  He
remembered the request of Annot.  Never had the latter
seemed brighter, dearer, or sweeter too, than that morning
when she playfully asked him to bring a golden pheasant's
wing, and secretly returned his farewell caress with such joy
and warmth.
</p>

<p>
Dropping a charge into one of his barrels, he fired, but
failed to kill the bird, which, hit somewhere, beat the earth
with its wings and rolled or ran forward into the mist.
Dropping his gun, Roland darted forward after it&mdash;the tendril
of a bramble caught his feet, and a gasping cry escaped
him as he fell heavily on his face and then downward&mdash;he
knew not where!
</p>

<p>
Instinctively and desperately he clutched something; it
was turf on a rocky edge.  He felt it yielding; a small tree,
a silver birch, grew near, and wildly he caught a branch
thereof; and swung out over some profundity, he knew not
what or where, till like a flash of lightning there came upon
his memory the Burn Cleugh, a deep, rocky chasm, which
had been the mysterious terror of his boyhood&mdash;as the
fabled shade of a treacherous kelpie, a hairy fiend with red
eyes and red claws&mdash;a rent or rift in the low hills some
miles from his home, and at the bottom of which, about
sixty feet and more below, the burn referred to as passing
through the Earl's Haugh, and near the hamlet of the same
name, flowed towards Eden.
</p>

<p>
'Save me&mdash;God save me!' rose to his lips, and with each
respiration as he clung to the branch and the bead-drops
started to his forehead, he lived a lifetime&mdash;a lifetime as it
were of keenest agony.
</p>

<p>
He knew well the profoundity of the rocky abyss that
yawned in obscurity below him, and he heard the slow
gurgle of the burn as it chafed against the stones that barred
its downward passage, and, mechanically, as one in a dream
who fears to fall, he strove to sway his body upward, but
could find no rest for his footsteps, and felt that the birch
branch to which he clung was gradually but surely&mdash;rending!
He had no terror of death in itself&mdash;none of death in the
battlefield, as we have shown; but from such a fate as this
he shrank; his soul seemed to die within him, and with
every respiration there seemed to come the agony of a
whole lifetime.
</p>

<p>
His nerve was gone, and no marvel that it was so.  He
might escape instant death; but not the most dreadful
mutilation; and, sooth to say, he dreaded that a thousand
times more than death.
</p>

<p>
One glance downward into that dark and misty chasm
was in itself a summons to death, and he knew well the
terrible bed of stones and boulders that lay below.
</p>

<p>
He became paralyzed&mdash;paralyzed with a great and stunning
fear.  The rending of the branch continued; his arms
were waxing faint and strained; his fingers feeble; and it
was only a question of moments between time and
eternity&mdash;fall&mdash;fall he must&mdash;how far&mdash;how deep down&mdash;the depth
he had forgotten.
</p>

<p>
The suspense was horrible; yet it was full of the dire
certainty of a dreadful end.
</p>

<p>
Every act and scene of his past life came surging up to
memory&mdash;the memory of less than a minute, now.
</p>

<p>
The branch parted; but, still grasping it, down he went
whizzing through the mist&mdash;there was a stunning crash as
he fell first on a ledge of rock and then into the stream's
stony bed below, and then sight and sense and sound
passed away from him!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
How long he lay there he knew not.  After a time consciousness
returned, but he felt himself incapable of action&mdash;of
motion&mdash;almost of thinking.
</p>

<p>
The ledge or shelf of rock, which was covered by soft
turf, had first received him, and thus broken the fall, which
ended, we have said, in the bed of the stream, in which he
was partially immersed from the waist downwards; but
whether his limbs were broken or dislocated he knew not
then, and there he lay helpless, with the cold current
trickling past and partly over him, the rocks towering
sharply and steeply up on either side of him to where their
summits were hidden in the masses of eddying mist, that
now began to rise and sink as the wind increased and the
afternoon began to close.
</p>

<p>
How long might he lie there undiscovered in that desolate
spot, which he knew so few approached?  How long would
he last, suffering as he did then?  And was a miserable
death, such as this&mdash;there and amid such surroundings&mdash;to
be the end of his young life, with all its bright hopes and
loving aspirations for the future?
</p>

<p>
Cold though he began to feel&mdash;icy cold&mdash;hot bead drops
suffused his temples at the idea, and at all his fancy began
to picture, and more than once a weak cry for aid escaped
him.
</p>

<p>
The Cleugh became more gloomy; he heard the bellowing
of the wind, and felt the falling rain, the torrents of
which were certain to swell and flood this tributary of the
Eden, and the terror of being drowned helplessly, as the
darkness fell and the water rose, impelled him to exertion,
and by efforts that seemed almost superhuman he contrived
to drag his bruised body and&mdash;as he felt assured&mdash;broken
limbs somewhat more out of the bed of the stream; but the
agony of this was so great that he nearly fainted.
</p>

<p>
With all his constitutional strength and hardihood, he
was certain that he could never survive the night; and even
if he did, the coming morning and day might bring him no
succour, for save when in search of a lost sheep or lamb in
winter, what shepherd ever sought the recesses of the
Kelpie's Cleugh?
</p>

<p>
As he lay there, with prayer in his heart and on his lips,
his whole past life&mdash;and then indeed did he thank God that
it had been well-nigh a blameless one&mdash;seemed to revolve
again and again as in a panorama before him; while a
thousand forgotten and minute details came floating back
rapidly and vividly to memory.
</p>

<p>
His boyhood, his dead brother, his mother's face, as he
had seen it bending over him tenderly in his little cot, while
she whispered the prayer she was wont to give over him
every night, till it became woven up with the life of his
infancy and riper years; his roystering, fox-hunting father;
his regiment&mdash;the jovial mess&mdash;the gallant parade, with
familiar faces seen amid the gleam of arms; his service in
Egypt&mdash;Tel-el-Kebir, with its frowning earthworks towering
through the star-lit gloom and dust of the night-march, till
the red artillery and musketry flashed over them in garlands
of fire, as the columns swept on and the Highland pipes sent
up their pæan of victory!
</p>

<p>
Then came memories of Kashgate&mdash;its bloody and
ghastly massacre&mdash;the flight therefrom into the desert; and
then sweet Merlwood and Hester Maule, and Annot with
her fair and goddess-like loveliness.
</p>

<p>
Then came the realities of the present again in all their
misery, power, and sway&mdash;the ceaseless rush of the cold
stream, the pouring rain upon his upturned face, the drifting
clouds, the occasional glinting of the stars, the rustle of
the wet leaves torn from the trees by the gusty wind, and
the too probable chances of the coming death through pain,
chill, exposure, and utter exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
Again, exerting all his powers, a despairing cry escaped
him, and this time a sound responded.  It was only a heron,
however, that, full of terror, seemed to flash out from its
nest in the rocks, and winged its way out of sight in a
moment.
</p>

<p>
As he lay there it seemed to him as if time had a
torturing power of spinning out its seconds, minutes, and hours
that he had never known it to have before.
</p>

<p>
But to lie there perishing within almost rifle-shot of the
roof under which he was born&mdash;so near his friends and so
many who loved him&mdash;Annot more than all&mdash;was a terrible
conviction&mdash;one apparently unnatural, unrealizable!
</p>

<p>
The mist had gone now, and the dark rocks between
which he lay began to assume strange and gruesome forms
in the weird light of the occasional stars, still more so when
once or twice a weird glimpse of the stormy moon penetrated
into the Cleugh.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, God!' cried he imploringly, 'to perish&mdash;to perish
thus!'
</p>

<p>
At that moment, in a swiftly passing gleam of moonshine,
he saw a face&mdash;a human face&mdash;peering over the rocks above
as if seeking to penetrate the watery gloom below, and again
a cry for help&mdash;help for the sake of mercy, for the sake of
Heaven, escaped him.
</p>

<p>
For a moment, we say, the face was there; the next it
vanished, as a dark mass of cloud swept over the silver
disc of the moon, and a sound, painfully and unmistakably
like a mocking laugh, reached the ears of the
sufferer.
</p>

<p>
The face&mdash;if face it actually was&mdash;and not that of the
fabled fiend, the Kelpie of the Cleugh, appeared no more;
the hours went by; no succour came, and Roland, as he
now resigned himself to the worst, believed that what he
had seen, or thought he had seen, was but the creation of
his own fevered and over-excited fancy.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap31"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXI.
<br /><br />
'ALL OVER NOW!'
</h3>

<p>
But it was no delirious delusion of Roland's that he had
seen a human face, or heard a human voice respond
mockingly to his despairing cry for aid.
</p>

<p>
It singularly chanced that about an hour before midnight,
and during a lull in the storm, Mr. Hawkey Sharpe,
who&mdash;as we have said&mdash;had been seen hovering about the
vicinity of Earlshaugh, was betaking himself thither, intent
on seeing his sister, the mistress thereof (whom he also
deemed his banker) concerning some of his monetary affairs,
and had been passing on foot by the narrow sheep-path that
skirted the verge of the dangerous Cleugh, when the
occasional cries of the sufferer reached his ear, and on peering
down he had speedily discovered by his voice <i>who</i> that
sufferer was.
</p>

<p>
He paused for a minute till quite assured of the fact, and
though at a loss to conceive how the event had come to
pass, he proceeded with quickened steps for some miles,
till he reached the private entrance&mdash;for which he had a
key&mdash;but not for the purpose of raising an alarm, or
procuring or sending forth succour.  Of that he had not the
least intention, as we shall show.  'In the place where the
tree falleth, there let it lie,' was the text of Mr. Hawkey
Sharpe just then.
</p>

<p>
He found the entire household on the <i>qui vive</i>, and heard
that Roland Lindsay was missing, thus corroborating to the
fullest extent any detail that might be wanting, and obviating
all doubt as to the episode at the Cleugh.
</p>

<p>
'What a fuss,' said he mockingly, 'about a storm of rain!'
</p>

<p>
It now rested with him, by the utterance of a single word,
or little more, to save the missing one from a miserable and
lingering death; but that word remained unuttered, and
with a grim and mocking smile upon his coarse lips, and a
gleam of fiendish joy in his watery gray eyes, he proceeded
to his sanctum, up the old turret stair, without the sensation
of his steps going downward according to the household
tradition.
</p>

<p>
'Lindsay lost in this storm!' he thought.  'How came
he to tumble or to be thrown down there&mdash;thrown, by
whom?' he added mentally, for his mind was ever prone to
evil.  'Then I am not wrong&mdash;it <i>was</i> his voice I heard at
the bottom of the Kelpie's Cleugh!  Ha! ha! let him lie
there till the greedy gleds pick his bones to pieces!
Well&mdash;come what may, I have had no hand in <i>this</i>!' he
continued, thinking doubtless of the charge of No. 5 aimed at
Captain Elliot.
</p>

<p>
Roland had often goaded Hawkey to the verge of madness
by his cool, haughty bearing and unassailable scorn,
even at times when the latter secretly amused him by the
'society' airs he strove to assume; but Hawkey's time for
vengeance seemed to have come unexpectedly and all
unsought for; and in fancy still he seemed to glare gloatingly
down into the dark chasm where the pale sufferer lay in his
peril, doubtless with many a bone broken, and the waters
of the burn rising fast, for the rain was falling in torrents,
and there was a <i>spate</i> in all the mountain streams.
</p>

<p>
Hawkey threw off his soaked coat, invested his figure in
a loose, warm <i>robe de chambre</i>, and took a bottle of his
favourite 'blend' from his private cellarette, after which he
threw himself into an easy-chair, with his feet upon another,
and strove to reflect.
</p>

<p>
'I always thought, if I could get rid of that fellow Lindsay
by fair means or foul, this place would certainly be mine,
unless Deb plays the fool&mdash;mine!  The girl in my way is
nothing, yet I may have her too, and if not, the <i>other</i> one
with the yellow hair.  After what I saw by a gleam of the
Macfarlanes' lantern to-night, the way seems pretty clear
now!'
</p>

<p>
He tugged his straw-coloured moustache, and after fixing
his eyes with a self-satisfied glare on vacancy for a full
minute, rang the bell for supper imperiously.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hawkey Sharpe was one who never troubled himself
about the past, and seldom about the future; his enjoyment
was in the present, and the mere fact of living well and
jollily without having work to do.
</p>

<p>
Just then he was pretty full of alcohol and exultant
hope&mdash;two very good things in their way to lay in a stock of.
He cared little what he did, but he dreaded greatly
discovery in any of his little trickeries.
</p>

<p>
To him the world was divided into two portions, those
who cheat and those who are cheated.
</p>

<p>
'Rid of Lindsay,' was the ever-recurring thought; 'rid of
his presence, local influence, and d&mdash;&mdash;d impudence, I shall
have this place again more than ever to myself, if I can only
throw a little dust in Deb's eyes, and have, perhaps, my
choice of these two stunning girls when I choke off that
other snob, Elliot.'
</p>

<p>
Excitement consequent on this most unlooked-for episode
at the Cleugh had nearly driven out of his mind the object
which had brought him that night to Earlshaugh, and his
last potations of hot whisky toddy at The Thane of Fife, a
tavern or roadside inn on the skirts of the park, had for a
time rather clouded his intellect, without, however, spoiling
his usually excellent appetite.
</p>

<p>
Thus when Tom Trotter arrived with a large silver tray&mdash;a
racing trophy of the late laird's career&mdash;covered with a
spotless white napkin, and having thereon curried lobster,
mutton cutlets, devilled kidneys, and beef kabobs on silver
skewers, with a bottle of Mumm, he drew in his chair and
made a repast, all the more pleasantly perhaps that he heard
at intervals the clang of the great house bell overhead, and
saw the lanterns of the searchers like glow-worms amid the
storm of rain and wind, as they set forth again on their
bootless errand, and then a smile that Mephistopheles might
have envied spread over his face.
</p>

<p>
'Lindsay lost!' he muttered jocularly.  'Well, there was
mair lost at Shirramuir when the Hielandman lost his faither
and mither, and a gude buff belt that was worth them
baith.'
</p>

<p>
He had a habit, when liquor loosened his tongue, of
soliloquizing, and he was in this mood to-night.
</p>

<p>
'Now, how to raise the ready!' he muttered, as he thrust
the silver salver aside, and drew the decanter once more
towards him, together with his briar-root and tobacco-pouch.
'The money I have lost must go to a fellow who is said to
possess the power of turning everything he touches to
gold&mdash;to gold!  Gad, could I only do that, I wouldn't even
sponge on old Deb in Earlshaugh, or wait for a dead
woman's shoes.  Besides, if I don't please her, she may
hand over the whole place to the Free Kirk; and, d&mdash;n
it, that's not to be thought of!&mdash;that body which, as she
always says, seceded so nobly, and scorned the loaves and
fishes.  If I could only get hold of Deb's cheque-book;
but she keeps everything so devilish close and secure!
When a fellow comes to be as I am,' he continued, rolling
his eyes about and lighting his pipe with infinite
difficulty&mdash;'bravo!&mdash;there's a devil of a gust of wind&mdash;hope you like
it, Lindsay&mdash;when a fellow, I say, comes to be as I am,
with an infinitesimal balance at the banker's and not much
credit with his tailor, he can't be particular to a shade what
he does&mdash;and so about the cheque-book&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What have you been doing <i>now</i>?' asked a voice behind him.
</p>

<p>
His sister Deborah again!  He grew very pale and nearly
dropped his pipe.  'How much had she overhead?' was
his first thought; 'curse this habit of thinking aloud!' was
his second.
</p>

<p>
'You are always stealing on a fellow unawares, Deb,' said
he, in a thick and uncertain voice; 'it is deuced
unpleasant&mdash;startles one so.'
</p>

<p>
Her face was pale as usual; but her eyes and mouth
expressed anger, pain, and a good deal of indignation and
contempt too.
</p>

<p>
'What have you done?' she demanded categorically.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing,' said he, striving to collect his thoughts; 'but
made my way here in a devil of a shower, for want of other
shelter.'
</p>

<p>
'You know what has happened?'
</p>

<p>
'To Lindsay&mdash;yes.'
</p>

<p>
'You do?' she exclaimed, making a step forward, with a
hand on her side, as if her usual pain was there.
</p>

<p>
'I know that he is absent&mdash;missing&mdash;that is all,' he replied
doggedly.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing more?'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing more&mdash;and care little, as you may suppose,' he
replied, avoiding her keen searching eye by carefully filling
his pipe.  'There is always some row on,' he grumbled;
'what a petty world this is after all&mdash;I wonder if the fixed
stars are inhabited.'
</p>

<p>
'That will not matter to you, I should think.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'You will go some other way, I fear.'
</p>

<p>
'Deb, your surmise is unpleasant.'
</p>

<p>
The manner of Hawkey Sharpe to his sister had lost, just
then, much of its general self-contained assurance.  She
detected the change, and it rendered her suspicious.
</p>

<p>
'Save this poor little dog Fifine,' said she, caressing the
cur she carried under an arm, and which was greedily
sniffing the <i>débris</i> of Mr. Hawkey's supper, 'I do not know
a living creature who really cares for me!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh&mdash;come now, Deb&mdash;hang it!' said her brother in an
expostulatory manner.
</p>

<p>
'You have some object in coming here to-night,' said she
sternly; 'to the point at once, Hawkey?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, since you force me, Deb&mdash;I have been unfortunate
in some speculations.'
</p>

<p>
'Is it thus you describe your losses on the race-course?'
</p>

<p>
'At the western meeting&mdash;yes&mdash;backed the wrong or
losing horse&mdash;<i>Scottish Patriot</i>&mdash;devil of a mess, Deb!'
</p>

<p>
'And lost&mdash;how much?  An unlucky name.'
</p>

<p>
'Two thousand pounds&mdash;must have the money somehow&mdash;I'm
booked for it, and you know the adage&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "A horse kicking, a dog biting,<br />
  A gentleman's word without his writing,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
are none of them in my way.'
</p>

<p>
'I know nothing of the adage, but this I know&mdash;there are
bounds to patience.'
</p>

<p>
'My dear Deb!' said he coaxingly.
</p>

<p>
'I have lost much&mdash;too much, indeed, through you&mdash;money
that might be put to good and holy uses&mdash;and now
shall lose no more!'
</p>

<p>
Turning abruptly, she swept away and left him.
</p>

<p>
He looked after her with absolutely a red glare of rage in
his pale gray eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Good and holy uses&mdash;meaning the kirk of course!' he
muttered with a savage malediction.  'We shall see&mdash;we
shall see.  She must have heard me muttering about her
cheque-book&mdash;ass that I am; but that money I must have
before three months are past if I rake Pandemonium for
it!'
</p>

<p>
Again the clanging of the house bell fell upon his ear, and
he heard the storm as it rose and died away to rise again.
He took another glass of stiff grog and glared at the great
antique clock on the mantel-shelf.
</p>

<p>
'Three in the morning,' he muttered.  'It must be all
over with <i>him</i> by this time&mdash;all over now!'

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
PELION ON OSSA.
</h3>

<p>
The rain and the wind were over; the storm had passed
away into the German Sea, as perhaps more than one luckless
craft found to its cost between Fife Ness and the shores
of Jutland.
</p>

<p>
It was over in the vicinity of Earlshaugh; the sluices of
heaven seemed to have emptied themselves at last; but the
atmosphere, if clear, was damp and laden with rain, and the
masses of ivy, rent and torn by the wind, flapped against the
walls of the old manor-house.
</p>

<p>
The hour was early; bright and clear the morning had
come from the German Sea, and a freshness lay over all the
fields and groves of the East Neuk.  After such a terrible
night there seemed something fairy-like in such a morning
with all its details, but the excitement was yet keen in
Earlshaugh.
</p>

<p>
The horse-chestnuts still wore their changing livery of
shining gold, and the mountain ash looked gray, but lime
and linden were alike nearly stripped of their leaves; and
when the breeze blew through the old oaks of the King's
Wood the pale acorns came tumbling out of their cups&mdash;the
tiny drinking-cups of the freakish elves that once abode in
the Fairy Den.
</p>

<p>
Old Jamie Spens, the ex-poacher, now came with startling
tidings to Earlshaugh.  A shepherd's dog&mdash;one of those
Scottish collies, of all dogs the most faithful, intelligent, and
useful, as they can discover by the scent any sheep that may
have the misfortune to be overblown by the snow, had been
seen careering wildly in the vicinity of the rocky Cleugh,
disappearing down it, to return to the verge barking and
yelping loudly, as if he had evidently discovered someone or
something there.
</p>

<p>
Old Spens had looked down, and too surely saw the
young laird lying pale, still, and motionless.
</p>

<p>
'Dead?' asked a score of voices.
</p>

<p>
'After sic a nicht and sic a fa' what could ye expect?' said
the old man with tears in his eyes as he remembered
Roland's kindness to himself, adding, as he shook his grizzled
head, 'but I hope no&mdash;I hope no.'
</p>

<p>
Spens had found Roland's gun, and a golden pheasant,
dead, near the edge of the Cleugh, for which a party at once
set out in all haste, Hester and Maude, pale and colourless
after such a sleepless night, too impatient to wait for the
pony phaeton which Jack Elliot offered to drive, preceding
them all, for the scene of the catastrophe was at some
distance from the house.
</p>

<p>
'They laugh longest who laugh last,' muttered Hawkey
Sharpe to himself, as&mdash;while pausing on the brow of an
eminence beyond the Weird Yett&mdash;he saw this party setting
forth, a large group of servants and keepers with poles and
ropes&mdash;and he shook his clenched hand mockingly and
threateningly as he added, 'do your best, but
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"In the midst of your glee,<br />
  You've no seen the last o' my bonnet and me!"'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Annot did not accompany this excited party; it might be
that her strength was unequal to it at such an hour and over
such ground, or it might be that she had not heart enough
for it.  There is no secret of the latter, says a French writer,
that our actions do not disclose; and as Annot's heart
seemed&mdash;well, Hester Maule cared not then to analyze it;
she was too disgusted to be angry.
</p>

<p>
But Annot, in all her selfish existence, had never before
been, as she thought, face to face with the most awful
tragedy of life&mdash;Death&mdash;and she shrank from the too
probable necessity now.
</p>

<p>
So she remained behind with Mrs. Lindsay.  She was not
accustomed to such rough weather and such exhibitions;
she would get her poor little feet wet; she was subject to
catching cold; the morning was full of rain and wind&mdash;it
was still quite tempestuous&mdash;such was never seen in
London; so Maude and Hester swept away in contemptuous
silence, leaving her, well shawled and cowering close to the
fire in Mrs. Lindsay's luxurious boudoir, and thought no
more about her, as she remained motionless, silent, and with
her eyes certainly full of tears, fixed on the changing features
of the glowing coals, and seeing her hopes of Earlshaugh too
probably drifting far away in distance, now!
</p>

<p>
Could this calamity be real? was the ever-recurrent
thought in the mind of Hester.  It seemed too fearful&mdash;too
horrible to be true!  Was she dreaming, and the victim of a
hideous nightmare, from which she would awake?
</p>

<p>
With all their impatience and anxiety to get on, the
keepers, servants, and others stepped short in mistaken
kindness or courtesy to the two young ladies who accompanied
them; but in an incredibly short space of time the
yawning Cleugh was reached, where the shepherd's faithful
dog was still on guard, bounding to and fro as they
approached, barking and yelping wildly; and with hearts that
beat high and painfully&mdash;every respiration seeming an
absolute spasm&mdash;Hester and Maude, who clung to Elliot's arm,
reached the verge of the chasm, and on looking down saw
too surely&mdash;as something like a wail escaped the lips of
each&mdash;Roland lying at the bottom, still and motionless, half in
and half out of the burn's rocky bed, as he, by the last efforts
of his strength, had painfully dragged or wrenched himself.
</p>

<p>
Exclamations of commiseration and pity were now heard
on every hand.
</p>

<p>
'This way, lads&mdash;round by the knowe foot,' cried old
Gavin Fowler.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;by the other way&mdash;the descent is easier!' said
Elliot authoritatively; but heedless of both suggestions,
Hester Maule, like the gallant girl as she was, took a path of
her own, and went plunging down the very face of the rocks,
apparently!
</p>

<p>
A cry of terror escaped the more timid Maude, as Hester
seemed to stumble and fall, or sway aside, but rose again and,
trembling, sobbing violently, in breathless and mental agony,
her delicate hands, which were gloveless, now torn and
bleeding by brambles and thorns, her beautiful brown hair
all unbound and rolling in a cascade down her back, finding
footing where others would have found none, grasping grass
and heather tufts; while the more wary were making a
circuit, she was the first to reach him, and kneel by his
side!
</p>

<p>
Raising his head, she laid her cheek upon his cold brow,
while her tears fell hot and fast, and for a moment she felt
that this helpless creature was indeed her own, whom even
Annot Drummond could not take from her then.
</p>

<p>
How pale, cold, sodden, and senseless he seemed!  With
a moan of horror that felt as if it came from her wildly
beating heart, Hester applied to his lips a tiny hunting flask
of brandy with which she had, with admirable foresight,
supplied herself, and almost unconsciously he imbibed a few
drops.
</p>

<p>
'Roland!' said Hester, in an agonized voice.
</p>

<p>
A litter flicker of the eyelashes was the only response.
</p>

<p>
'Thank God, he lives!' exclaimed the girl.
</p>

<p>
'Annot, Annot!' he murmured.
</p>

<p>
'Always&mdash;always the idea of chat girl!' sighed Hester
bitterly, and she withdrew her face from its vicinity to his
as Elliot, Gavin Fowler, Spens, and others came splashing
along the bed of the stream from two directions, above and
below the Cleugh, and ample succour had come now.
</p>

<p>
What his injuries were, whether internal or external, or
both, none could know then.  He seemed passive as a child,
weak and utterly exhausted.  To all it was but too apparent
that had succour been longer of coming it had come too
late; but now there was no lack of loving and tender hands
to bear him homeward, and into his father's house.
</p>

<p>
'Annot's name was the first word that escaped his lips,'
said Hester, as with torn and tremulous fingers she knotted
up her back hair into a coil, and seemed on the verge of
sinking, after her recent toil, and under her present
excitement and anxiety.
</p>

<p>
'That girl has been his evil genius&mdash;his weird&mdash;I think,'
said Maude, who never liked Annot, and mistrusted her;
'and he will never be free so long as this weird hangs
on him.'
</p>

<p>
'She, a Drummond!  The town-bred coward!' exclaimed
Hester, her dark violet eyes flashing fire, while she coloured
at her own girlish energy.
</p>

<p>
'The sooner she changes it to some characteristic one like
Popkins or Slopkins the better,' said Maude; 'but I think
she would prefer Lindsay.'
</p>

<p>
'Telegraph to Edinburgh at once for Professor &mdash;&mdash; and
Dr. &mdash;&mdash;,' said Mrs. Lindsay, naming two of the chief
medical men (as Roland was carried up to his room), and
evincing an interest that surprised Maude, and for which her
brother, Mr. Hawkey Sharpe, would not have thanked her.
</p>

<p>
'I'll see to that myself,' said Jack Elliot, betaking himself
at once to the stable-yard that he might ride to the nearest
railway-station, and meantime send on to Earlshaugh the
best local aid that could be obtained in hot haste.
</p>

<p>
Roland's injuries were serious undoubtedly, but not so
much so as had been feared at first.
</p>

<p>
These were a partial dislocation of the left thigh bone and
a strain of the right ankle, both of which bade fair to mar
his marching for many a day; with a general shock to the
whole system consequent on the fall (which, but for the turfy
ledge of rock that broke it, would have proved fatal) and
the exposure to the elements for a whole autumnal night of
storm and rain.  But with care and nursing, the faculty&mdash;after
pulling him about again and again till he was well-nigh
mad, after much tugging of their nether lips, as if in deep
thought, consultations over dry sherry and biscuit, and
pocketing big fees in an abstracted kind of manner&mdash;had
no doubt, not the slightest doubt, in fact, that with his
naturally fine constitution he would soon 'pull through.'
</p>

<p>
A crowd of people always hovered about the gate-lodges;
women came from their cottages, weavers, perhaps the last
of their trade, from their looms, and the ploughmen from
their furrows to inquire after the health of the young laird,
for such these kindly folks of the East Neuk deemed Roland
still, for of the mysterious will they knew little and cared
less; horsemen came and went, and carriages, too, the
owners with their faces full of genuine anxiety, for the
Lindsays of Earlshaugh were much respected and well
regarded as being among the oldest proprietors in a county
that has ever been rich in good old historical families; and
the veteran fox-hunting laird had been a prime favourite in
the field with all his compatriots.  So again, as before,
during Jack Elliot's mishap, the bell of the <i>porte-cochère</i> sent
forth its clang in reply to many a kind inquiry.
</p>

<p>
And many agreed with Maude that none in Earlshaugh
were likely to forget the unfortunate shooting season of that
particular year, as this calamity seemed to surpass the last.
It was grief upon grief, like the classic piling of Pelion
on Ossa.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br /><br />
A TANGLED SKEIN.
</h3>

<p>
Natheless the fair promises of the faculty, Roland Lindsay
seemed to hover between life and death for days.  They
were a time of watching, hoping, and fearing, and hoping
again, till every heart that loved him grew sick with
apprehension and anxiety.
</p>

<p>
At first he looked like one all but dead; the great charm
of his face lay in the earnest and thoughtful expression of
his eyes, and in their rich brown colour; both were gone now,
and the clearly cut and refined lips, that denoted a brave,
gentle, and kindly nature, were blue and drawn; and a
slight sword cut upon the cheek, won at Kashgate, looked
rather livid just then.
</p>

<p>
He was exhausted, languid, and passive, but, at times,
seemed to awaken into quickened intelligence; then anon
his mind would wander a little, and the names of Hester
and Annot were oddly mingled on his feverish tongue.
</p>

<p>
But there was great joy when he became sensible of the
perfume of flowers&mdash;the sweetest from the conservatory&mdash;culled
and arranged by the loving hands of the former, in
the vases that ornamented his room, and when he fully
recognised the latter in attendance upon him.
</p>

<p>
'My little wife&mdash;my child-wife that is to be,' he whispered,
'you love me still, though I am all shattered in this
fashion?'
</p>

<p>
Then Annot caressed his hand, and placed her cheek
upon it.
</p>

<p>
Guests had all departed, the key was turned in the
gun-room door; the dogs were idle in their kennels, and only
Elliot, Hester, and Annot remained as visitors at Earlshaugh.
The great house seemed very silent now; but Roland, as
strength and thought returned, was thankful that the guests
he had invited were gone.  The difficulty of their presence
had been tided over without any unpleasantness (save the
affair of Elliot and Sharpe), and now he felt only a loathing
of his paternal home, with an intense longing to be gone&mdash;to
get well and strong&mdash;to keep well, and then go, he cared
not where at first, so that Annot was with him, and then back
to the regiment as soon as possible, even before his leave
was ended.
</p>

<p>
Annot was now&mdash;unlike the Annot who cowered over the
boudoir fire on the morning when Roland was rescued&mdash;most
effusive in her expressions of regard and compassion,
though she was perhaps the most useless assistant a nurse
could have in a sick room, the air of which 'so oppressed
her poor little head;' and thus she was secretly not
ill-pleased when her services there were firmly, but politely,
dispensed with by old Mrs. Drugget, the portly housekeeper,
who had nursed Roland and his dead brother many a time
in their earlier years, and now made herself, as of old,
mistress of the situation.
</p>

<p>
Annot's bearing on the eventful morning referred to
rankled in the memory of Maude and Hester.  They strove
to dissemble and veil their growing dislike to, and mistrust
of, her under their old bearing and cordiality of habit; but
almost in vain, despite her winning, clinging, and child-like
ways and pretty tricks of manner.  These seemed to fall
flatly now on ear and eye, and soon events were to
transpire with regard to that young lady which gave them cause
for much speculation, suspicion, and positive anger.
</p>

<p>
She was soon sharp enough to discover that there was a
growing cloud between them, and took the precaution of
giving a hint thereof to Roland.  She was somewhat of a
flirt, he knew very well; but there was no one in the house
to flirt with, now that Malcolm Skene and all the others
were gone; and he had consoled himself with the reflection
that she was devoted to him, and that her little flirtations
had been of a harmless nature, and the outcome of a spirit
of fun and <i>espièglerie</i>.
</p>

<p>
And if Hester and Maude were somewhat disposed to be
severe on Annot and reprehend this, he knew by experience
that ladies who adopt the <i>rôle</i> of pleasing the opposite sex
are rarely appreciated by their fair sisters.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Lindsay when she visited Roland from time to time,
as he thought to watch his progress towards health and
departure, felt thankful, though of course she gave no hint
thereof, that her brother had at least no active hand in the
misfortune that had befallen him.
</p>

<p>
'The guests I somewhat intrusively invited here are all
gone, Mrs. Lindsay,' said he on one occasion, 'and I shall
soon relieve you, I hope, of the trouble my own presence
gives you.'
</p>

<p>
'Captain Lindsay&mdash;Roland&mdash;do not talk so,' she replied,
either feeling some compunction then for the false position
of them both, or veiling her old constitutional dislike of him,
which, Roland cared not now.  Calm, cold, self-contained,
and self-possessed, Mrs. Lindsay, as usual, was beautifully
and tastefully dressed in rich black material, with fine lace
lappets over her thick, fair hair, and setting off her
colourless and lineless face.  Her expression, we have said
elsewhere, was not ill-tempered but generally hard and
unsympathetic, and now it was softer than Roland had ever
seen it, and something of a smile like watery sunshine
hovered about her thin and firm lips, and to his surprise
she even stroked his hair with something of maternal
kindness as she left him, pleased simply because he had uttered
some passing compliment to the effect that he was glad to see
her looking so well and in such good health.  But she and
Maude were not, never were, and never could be, friends.
</p>

<p>
'I should like to know precisely the secret of this prison
house,' thought the observant Annot, as she saw this unusual
action.
</p>

<p>
If a 'prison house,' it suited her tastes admirably; but
she was fated to learn some of the secrets thereof sooner
perhaps than she wished.
</p>

<p>
A month and more had passed now; Roland was becoming
convalescent; he could even enjoy a cigar or pipe
with Jack Elliot, and had been promoted from his bed to a
couch in a cosy corner of his room; and he felt that now
the time had come when he ought to break to Annot the
true story of how monetary matters stood with him at
Earlshaugh.
</p>

<p>
A heavy feeling gathered in his heart as this conviction
forced itself upon him&mdash;a sensation as of lead; yet he
scorned to think that he would have to cast himself upon
her generosity, or ask for her pity.
</p>

<p>
Compared with what might and ought to have been, his
prospects now were, in many respects, gloomy to look
forward to; but he had fully taken breathing time before
breaking to her news which, he greatly feared, might be
testing and grievously disappointing.
</p>

<p>
But it would be unmanly to trifle longer with Annot, or
dally with their mutual fate.  Yet how was he to preface
the most unwelcome intelligence that he was no longer&mdash;indeed,
never was&mdash;laird of that stately mansion and splendid
estate, with all its fields, wood, and waters?
</p>

<p>
How he dreaded the humiliating revelation&mdash;yet why so,
if she loved him?
</p>

<p>
Taking an opportunity when they were alone, and the
two other girls, escorted by Elliot, had gone for a 'spin' on
horseback, he drew her tenderly towards him, with one arm
round her slender waist and one hand clasping hers, which
still had his engagement ring on a baby-like finger, while
gazing earnestly down into her sunny eyes, which were
uplifted to his with something of inquiry in them, he said:
</p>

<p>
'I have news, darling&mdash;terrible news to reveal to you at
last.'
</p>

<p>
'News?' she repeated in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
'Of a nature, perhaps, beyond your imagining,' said he
in a voice that became low and husky despite its tenderness.
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean, Roland?  You frighten me, dearest!'
</p>

<p>
He pressed her closer to him, and she felt that his hands
were trembling violently.
</p>

<p>
'Annot, I have a hundred times and more heard you say
that you loved me for myself, and would continue to love
me were I poor&mdash;poor as Job himself.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course I have often said so, and I do love you; but
why do you ask this question now?  What has happened?
Why are you so strange?' she asked, changing colour and
looking decidedly restless in eye and manner.  'Are you
not well?  How cold your poor hands are, and how they
tremble!'
</p>

<p>
She drooped her fairy-like head, with all its wealth of
shining golden hair, upon his shoulder, and looked upward
keenly, if tenderly, into his downcast eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Has any new calamity occurred to distress you?'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing that is new&mdash;to me.'
</p>

<p>
'Why, then&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'It is this.  I am not Lindsay of Earlshaugh&mdash;not the
owner of the estate I mean.  I am poor, poor, Annot, yet
not penniless; I have my old allowance and my pay&mdash;but
this beautiful estate is not mine.'
</p>

<p>
'Not yours?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;not a foot of it&mdash;not a tree&mdash;not a stone!'
</p>

<p>
Her lips were firmly set, and the rose-leaf tint in her
delicate cheeks died away.
</p>

<p>
'Whose, then, is it?'
</p>

<p>
'My father&mdash;weakly&mdash;my father&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'To whom did he leave the property?' she asked, lifting
her head from his shoulder and speaking with a sharpness
he did not then notice; 'is it as I have heard whispered?'
</p>

<p>
'To my stepmother&mdash;yes.  You knew of that&mdash;you
suspected it, my darling?' he added, with a sudden access
of hope and joy&mdash;hope in her unselfishness and purity of
love.
</p>

<p>
She made no immediate reply.
</p>

<p>
'Is this unjust will tenable?' she asked, after a time.
</p>

<p>
'It is without flaw, Annot.  My father left her all he
possessed, with the power of bequeathing it to whom she
pleases, without hindrance or restriction.'
</p>

<p>
'Cruel and infamous!  And who, my poor Roland, is
her heir?'
</p>

<p>
'That reptile, Hawkey Sharpe, I presume.'
</p>

<p>
Something between a gasping sigh and a nervous laugh
escaped Annot, who said, after a little pause, during
which he regarded her fair face with intense and yearning
anxiety:
</p>

<p>
'I thought you as prosperous a gentleman as the Thane
of Cawdor himself; but this is terrible&mdash;terrible!'
</p>

<p>
And as she spoke there was something in her tone
that jarred painfully on his then sensitive and overstrung
nerves.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Annot assured him of her unalterable love, whatever lay
before them&mdash;whatever happened or came to pass&mdash;was he
not her own&mdash;her very own!  She wound her arms about
his neck; she caressed him in her sweet, and to all
appearance, infantile way, striving to reassure him; to soothe,
console, and implant fresh confidence in his torn and
humbled heart; but with all this, there was a new and
curious ring in her voice&mdash;a want of something in its tone,
and erelong in her eye and manner, that stung him keenly
and alarmed him.
</p>

<p>
What did this mean?  Did she resent his supposed
duplicity as to his means and position?  But he consoled
himself that he would soon have her away from Earlshaugh,
with all its influences, associations, and the false hopes and
impressions it had given her, and then she would be his
own&mdash;his own indeed.
</p>

<p>
'How loving, how true, gentle, and good she is!  Do I
indeed deserve such disinterested affection?' were his
constant thoughts.
</p>

<p>
He disliked, however, to find that Annot had begun to
cultivate the friendship of Mrs. Lindsay&mdash;"Deb Sharpe" as
she was uncompromisingly called by Maude, who was
always on most distant terms with that personage; and to
find that she was ever in or about her rooms, doing little
acts of daughter-like attention such as Maude, with all her
sweetness of disposition, had never accorded; even to
fondling, feeding, and washing her snarling pug Fifine; and
Mrs. Lindsay, of whom other ladies had always been
rather shy, and towards whom they had always comported
themselves somewhat coldly and with that cutting hauteur
which even the best bred women can best assume, felt
correspondingly grateful to the little London beauty for
her friendship and recognition.
</p>

<p>
The splendour of the house, the richness of the ancient
furniture and appurtenances, the delicacies of the table, the
attendance, the comfortable profusion of everything, had
been duly noted and duly appreciated by Annot, and she
felt that it was with sincere regret she would quit the
fleshpots of Earlshaugh.
</p>

<p>
More than once, when promenading about the corridors
with the aid of a stick, Roland had surprised her in
tears.
</p>

<p>
'Tears&mdash;my darling&mdash;why&mdash;what!' he began.
</p>

<p>
'It is nothing,' she replied, with a little flush.  'I am
oppressed, I suppose, by the emptiness and size of this
great house.  I am such an impressionable little thing you
know, Roland.'
</p>

<p>
'We can't amend the size of the house,' said he, smiling,
'but a cosier and a smaller one awaits us elsewhere, when
you are my dear little wife, and we quit this place, once so
dear to me, as I never thought to quit it in disgust&mdash;for
ever!'
</p>

<p>
Seeing the varying moods of Annot, and the occasional
petulance, even coldness, with which she sometimes ventured
to treat Roland now, Hester, remembering that young
lady's confidences with reference to Mr. Bob Hoyle and
other 'detrimentals,' her avowed passion for money, and
how a moneyed match was a necessity of her life, and
knowing Roland's changed position and fortunes&mdash;Hester,
we say, was not slow in putting 'two and two together,' to
use a common adage, to the detriment of Annot in her
estimation.
</p>

<p>
'I would that I were a strong-minded woman,' said the
latter reproachfully, as she and Roland lingered one evening
in a corridor that was a veritable picture gallery (for there
hung the Lindsays of other days, as depicted by the brushes
of the Jamesons, the Scougals, De Medinas, Raeburns, and
Watsons in the striking costumes of their times), and
Roland had been taking her a little to task for some of her
petulant remarks.
</p>

<p>
'A strong-minded woman,' he repeated.  'Nonsense!
But why?'
</p>

<p>
'Then I should cease to annoy you, and join an Anglican
Sisterhood, to nurse the poor and all that sort of thing.'
</p>

<p>
She pouted prettily as she spoke&mdash;sweetly, with all her
softest dimples coming into play.
</p>

<p>
'Are you not perfectly happy, Annot?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, yes&mdash;yes!' she exclaimed, and interlaced her fingers
on his arm; yet he eyed her moodily, and lovingly, ignorant
of the secret source of her discontent or disquietude.
</p>

<p>
'How can I take her to task,' thought he; 'already
too! so fair, so bright, with her hair like spun gold!'
</p>

<p>
He tried to catch and retain her loving glance, but the
corners of her pretty mouth were drooping, and her eyes of
pale hazel looked dreamily and vacantly out on the far
extent of sunlit park and the white fleecy clouds that
floated above it; but he thought he read that in her face
which made him long for health and strength to take her
away from Earlshaugh to the new home he had now begun
to picture, and seldom a day passed now without something
occuring to increase this wish.
</p>

<p>
'Roland,' said Maude on one occasion, as she drove
him out through the pleasant lanes in her pretty pony phaeton,
'that odious creature Hawkey Sharpe is still, I understand,
hovering about here.'
</p>

<p>
'Bent on mischief, you think?'
</p>

<p>
'Too probably.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I am powerless to prevent him.  He is, you
know, his sister's factotum and now all but Laird of
Earlshaugh.'
</p>

<p>
Though possessing no brilliant beauty, the face of the
sunny-haired Maude was one usually full of merriment, and
capable of expressing intense tenderness&mdash;one winning
beyond all words; but it grew cloudy and stern at the
thought of 'these interlopers,' as she always called
them&mdash;Deborah Sharpe and her obnoxious brother.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIV.
<br /><br />
THE PRESENTIMENT.
</h3>

<p>
Among her letters one morning&mdash;though her chief correspondent
was her father, the old Indian veteran at Merlwood,
whose shaky caligraphy there was no mistaking&mdash;there came
one which gave Hester a species of electric shock.  It bore
the postmarks 'Egypt' and 'Cairo,' with stamps having the
Pyramids and Sphinx's head thereon.
</p>

<p>
'From Malcolm Skene!' she said to herself; 'Malcolm
Skene, and to <i>me</i>!'
</p>

<p>
She hurried to her room that she might read it in solitude,
for it was impossible that she could fail to do so with deep
interest after all that Malcolm Skene had said to her, and
the knowledge of all that might have been&mdash;yea, yet perhaps
might be; but the letter, dated more than a month before at
Cairo, simply began:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
'MY DEAR MISS MAULE,
</p>

<p>
'My excuse for writing to you,' he continued, 'is&mdash;and
your pardon must be accorded to me therefore&mdash;that I am
ordered on a distant, solitary, and perilous duty, from which
I have, for the first time in my life, a curious, yet solemn,
presentiment that I shall never return.
</p>

<p>
'This emotion may, please God, be a mistake; and I
hope so, for my dear mother's sake.  It may only be that
superstition which some deem impiety; but we Skenes of
Dunnimarle have had it in more than one generation&mdash;a
kind of foreknowledge of what was to happen to us, or to
be said or done by those we met.  As some one has it, the
map of coming events is before us, and the spirit surveys
it, and for the time we are translated into another sphere,
and re-act, perhaps, foregone scenes.  Be that as it may,
the unbidden emotion of presentiment seems to have some
affinity to that phenomenon.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'What a strange letter; and how unlike Malcolm&mdash;thoughtful
and grave as he is!' was Hester's idea.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'I read a few days ago that some calamity had occurred
at Earlshaugh; that my dear old friend and comrade
Roland had met with an accident&mdash;had <i>disappeared</i>!  What
did that mean?  But too probably I shall never learn now,
and, as I have not again seen the matter referred to in
print, hope it may all be a canard&mdash;a mistake.
</p>

<p>
'You remember our last interview?  Oh, Hester, while
life remains to me I shall never, never forget it?  I think
or hope you may care for me now in pity as we are separated&mdash;or
might learn to care for me at a future time.  Tell
me to wait that time; if I return from my mission, Hester,
and I shall do so&mdash;yea, were it seven years, if you wish it
to be&mdash;if at the end of those seven years you would lay
your dear hand in mine and tell me that you would be my
wife.
</p>

<p>
'The waiting would be hard; yet, if inspired by hope, I
would undergo it, Hester, and trust while life was spared to
me.  We are told that "the meshes of our destiny are
spinning every day," silently, deftly, and we unconsciously
aid in the spinning&mdash;scarcely knowing that&mdash;as we stumble
through the darkness to the everlasting light&mdash;the dangers
we have passed by, and the fires we have passed through,
are all, in different ways, the process that makes us godlike,
strong and free.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Much more followed that was a little abstruse, and then
he seemed to become loving and tender in spite of the
manner in which he strove to modify his letter.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'I depart in an hour, and tide what may, my last thoughts
will ever be of you&mdash;my last wish a prayer for your happiness!
My life's love&mdash;my life's love, for such you are still&mdash;once
more farewell!
</p>

<p class="noindent">
'MALCOLM SKENE.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Certainly the gentle-hearted Hester could not but be
moved by this letter, coming as it did under all the circumstances
from the writer in a remote and perilous land.  She
looked at the date after perusing the letter more than once,
and her spirit sank with a dread of what might have
transpired since then.
</p>

<p>
She recalled vividly the face of Malcolm Skene, and his
eyes, that were soft yet full of power, more frequently grave
than merry, and his firm lips.  He was a man whose
features and bearing would have been remarkable amid any
group of men, and the first to arrest a woman's attention
and arouse her interest.
</p>

<p>
But as she re-read his expressions of love she shook her
handsome head slowly and gravely, and thought with
Collins:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Friendship often ends in love,<br />
  But love in friendship never!'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
To this letter a terrible sequel was close at hand.  This she
found in the newspapers of the following day, and while her
whole mind was full of that remarkable and most unexpected
missive to which she could send no answer:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Captain Malcolm Skene, who with a native guide quitted
Cairo some weeks ago, has not been heard of since he
entered the Wady Faregh, at a point more than ten Egyptian
<i>shoni</i> or thirty miles British, beyond Memphis, which was
not in his direct way.
</p>

<p>
'This energetic and distinguished young officer is the
bearer of despatches to the Egyptian Colonel commanding
a Camel Battery and Black Battalion near Dayer-el-Syrian,
which district he certainly had not reached when the latest
intelligence came from that somewhat desolate quarter.
</p>

<p>
'Doubts are now&mdash;when too late&mdash;entertained as to the
fidelity of Hassan Abdullah, his guide.  A camel supposed
to have been his has been found dead of thirst in the
desert, and as there have been some dreadful sand-storms
in that district, the greatest fears are entertained at
headquarters that Captain Skene has perished in the
wilderness&mdash;dying in the execution of his duty to his Queen and
country, as truly and as bravely as if he had met a soldier's
death in battle.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The paper slipped from Hester's hands, and she sank
forward till her forehead rested on the sill of a window near
which she sat.  She knew this paragraph meant too probably
a terrible and unknown death, the harrowing details of
which might&mdash;nay, too surely, never would&mdash;be revealed&mdash;death
to one who had loved her but too well, and thus all
her soul became instinct with a tender and fearful interest
in him.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Malcolm&mdash;poor Malcolm Skene!' she murmured
again and again, while her face, ashy white, was hidden in
her hands.
</p>

<p>
Few women can fail to take a tender interest in the fate
or future of any man who has been <i>interested</i> in them.
</p>

<p>
For a long time she sat still&mdash;nay, still as a statue, but
for the regular and slow rising and falling of the ribbons
and lace at her bosom, and the ruffling of her dark brown
hair in the breeze that came through the open window,
kissing her white temples and cooling her eyelids.
</p>

<p>
Then she recalled her father's strange and weird story of
his father's dream, vision, or presentiment, before the
storming of Jhansi, where the latter fell; and thought with
wonder, could such things be?
</p>

<p>
She confided the letter and its contents to her bosom
friend Maude; but she could not&mdash;for cogent reasons&mdash;bring
herself to say a word on the subject to Roland, whose
mind, however, was full enough of the newspaper report
of his old friend's misfortune, or as he never doubted
now&mdash;evil fate!

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXV.
<br /><br />
LOST IN THE DESERT.
</h3>

<p>
Natheless his somewhat gloomy letter to Hester Maule,
Malcolm Skene, though feeling to the fullest extent the
influence of the presentiment of evil therein referred to, was
too young, and of too elastic a nature, not to feel also a
sense of ardour, enterprise, and enthusiasm at the
confidence reposed in him by his superiors.  With an inherent
love of adventure and a certain recklessness of spirit, he
armed himself, mounted, and quitted his quarters at Cairo
just when the first red rays of the morning sun were tipping
with light the summit of the citadel or the apex of each
distant pyramid, and rode on his solitary way&mdash;solitary all
save Hassan, the swarthy Egyptian guide provided for him
by the Quartermaster-General's Department.
</p>

<p>
He had been chiefly selected for the duty in question&mdash;to
bear despatches to the <i>Amir-Ali</i>, or Colonel, commanding
the Egyptian force at Dayr-el-Syrian, in consequence of his
proficiency in Arabic&mdash;the most prevailing language of the
country.
</p>

<p>
He and his guide were mounted on camels.  Skene's was
one of great beauty, if an animal so ungainly can be said
to possess it, with a small head, short ears, and bending
neck.  Its tail was long, its hoofs small, and it was swift of
action.  The rider was without baggage; he wore his fighting
kit of Khakee cloth and tropical helmet with a pugaree.
He had his sword and revolver, with goggles, and a pocket
compass for use if his guide in any way proved at fault.
</p>

<p>
Unnoticed he traversed the picturesque streets that lay
between the citadel and the gate that led by a straight road
towards the castle and gardens of Ghizeh, passing the groups
and features incident to Cairo: a lumbering train of British
baggage waggons, escorted by our soldiers in clay-coloured
khakee with bayonets fixed; an Egyptian officer in sky-blue
uniform and red tarboosh 'tooling' along on a circus-like
Arab; a whole regiment of darkies, perhaps with rattling
drums and French bugles; strings of maimed, deformed,
and blind beggars; private carriages with outriders in
Turkish costumes of white muslin with gold embroideries,
and bare-legged grooms; 'the gallant, gray donkeys of
which Cairo is so proud, and which the Cairenes delight in
naming after European celebrities, from Mrs. Langtry to
Lord Wolseley;' singers of Nubian and Arabian songs and
dealers in Syrian magic, all were left behind, and in the cool
air of the morning Malcolm Skene found himself ambling
on his camel under the shadows of the lebbek trees, with
wading buffaloes and flocks of herons on either side of the
road as he skirted the plain where the Pyramids stand&mdash;the
Pyramids that mock Time, which mocks all things.
</p>

<p>
He was too familiar with them then to bestow on them
more than a passing glance, and rode forward on his
somewhat lonely way.  Hassan, his guide, like a true Arab,
uttered a mocking yell on seeing the vast stony face of the
Sphinx&mdash;an efrit&mdash;fired a pistol, and threw stones at it, as
at a devil, and then civilization was left behind.
</p>

<p>
Trusting to his guide Hassan, Skene was taken a few
miles off his direct route southward down the left bank of
the Nile, and while riding on, turning from time to time to
converse with that personage, who was a typical Fellah&mdash;very
dark-skinned, with good teeth, black and sparkling
eyes, muscular of form, yet spare of habit, and clad simply
in loose blue cotton drawers with a blue tunic and red
tarboosh&mdash;it seemed that his face and voice were somehow
not unfamiliar to him.
</p>

<p>
But where, amid the thousands of low-class Fellaheen in
Cairo, could Malcolm Skene have seen the former or heard
the latter?  Never before had he heard of Hassan
Abdullah even by name.  But 'strange it is, for how many
days and weeks we may be haunted by a <i>likeness</i> before we
know what it is that is gladdening us with sweet recollections,
or vexing us with some association we hoped to have
left behind.'
</p>

<p>
Memphis, with its ruins and mounds, in the midst of
which stand the Arab hamlets of Sokkara and Mitraheny,
was traversed with some difficulty, though the site is now
chiefly occupied by waste and marshes that reach to the
sand-hills on the edge of the desert; but from Abusir all
round to the west and south, for miles, Skene and his guide
found themselves stepping from grave to grave amid bones
and fragments of mummy cloth&mdash;the remains of that wondrous
necropolis which, according to Strabo, extended half
a day's journey each way from the great city of Central Egypt.
</p>

<p>
'Ugh!' muttered Malcolm Skene, as he guided the steps
of his camel and lighted more than one long havannah,
'this is anything but lively!  What a dismal scene!'
</p>

<p>
'The work of the Pharaohs,' said Hassan, for to them
everything is attributed by the Fellaheen, who suppose they
lived about three hundred years ago.
</p>

<p>
But Memphis was ere long left in his rear, and night was
at hand, when&mdash;according to Hassan Abdullah's statement,
on computation of distance&mdash;they should reach and halt at
certain wells, about ten <i>shoni</i> distant therefrom, in the direct
line to the Wady Faregh.
</p>

<p>
Memphis was, we say, left behind, and the two rode
swiftly on.  His former thoughts recurring to him, Malcolm
Skene, checking his camel to let that of his guide come
abreast of him, said to the latter:
</p>

<p>
'Your face is singularly familiar to me.  Did we ever
meet in Cairo?'
</p>

<p>
Hassan grinned and showed all his white teeth, but made
no reply.
</p>

<p>
'Your face <i>has</i> some strange mystery for me,' resumed
Skene, with growing wonder, yet fearing he might make the
man think he possessed the evil eye; 'it seems a face
known to me&mdash;the face of the dead in the garb of the
living.'
</p>

<p>
'And it is so, <i>Yusbashi</i> (captain), so far as <i>you</i> are
concerned,' was the strange reply of the Fellah as his black
eyes flashed.
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'We met in the roulette saloon of Pietro Girolamo.'
</p>

<p>
'Right!  I remember now; you are one of the fellows I
fought with.  I thought you were killed in that row!'
</p>

<p>
'Nearly so I was, and by <i>you</i>.'
</p>

<p>
This was an awkward discovery.
</p>

<p>
'But you escaped?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; thanks to an amulet I wear&mdash;a verse of the Koran
bound round my left arm.'
</p>

<p>
To trust such a rascal as Skene now supposed this fellow
must be was full of peril.  To return and seek another
guide, when he had proceeded so far upon his way, would
argue timidity, and tempt the 'chaff' of the more heedless
spirits of the mess; thus it was not to be thought of.
</p>

<p>
He could but continue his journey with his despatches,
and watch well every movement of his guide; but to have
as such one of the ruffians and bullies of Pietro Girolamo
was certainly an unpleasant discovery&mdash;one with whom he
had already that which in these parts of the world is termed
a <i>blood feud</i>, seemed to be the first instalment of his gloomy
presentiment.
</p>

<p>
Hassan Abdullah had been&mdash;he could not conceive how
or why&mdash;chosen or recommended as a guide by those in
authority; and if false, or disposed to be so, he veiled it
under an elaborate bearing of servility and attention to
every wish and hint of Skene.  Thinking that he could not
make any better of the situation now, Malcolm was fain to
accept that bearing for what it might be worth, and, to veil
his mistrust, adopted a new tone with Hassan, and instead
of listening to directions from him, began to give orders
instead.  But, ignorant as he was of the route, this system
could not long be pursued.
</p>

<p>
As he rode on he thought of Hester Maule, and how she
would view or consider his letter.  Would she answer it?
He scarcely thought she would do so&mdash;nay, became certain
she would not.  Under the circumstances in which they
had parted after that interview in the conservatory at
Earlshaugh, and with the grim presentiment then haunting him,
it was beseeming enough in him perhaps to have written as
he did to her; but not for her to write him in reply unless
she meant to hold out hopes that might never be realized.
</p>

<p>
What amount of ground they had traversed when the
sun verged westward Malcolm scarcely knew, as the way
had been most devious, rough, and apparently, to judge of
the guide's indecision more than once, very uncertain; but
the former judged that it could not have been more than
thirty miles from Memphis as the crow flies.
</p>

<p>
Dhurra reeds, date, and cotton-trees had long since been
left behind, and before the camel-riders stretched a pale
yellow waste of sand, strewed in places by glistening
pebbles.  Malcolm Skene thought they were now entering
the lower end of the Wady Faregh, between El Benat and
the Wady Rosseh, and on consulting his pocket-compass
supposed the Dayr Macarius Convent must be right in his
front, but distant many miles, and the post of Dayr-el-Syrian,
for which he was bound, must be about ten miles
further on; but Hassan Abdullah knew better; and when
near sunset that individual dismounted and spread his dirty
little square carpet whereon to say his orisons, with his face
towards Mecca, his head bowed, his beads in his dingy
hands, and his cunning eyes half closed.  None would have
thought that a Mussulman apparently so pious had only
hate and perfidy in his heart for the trusting but accursed
infidel, or <i>Frenchi</i>, as he called Skene&mdash;the general name in
Egypt for all Europeans&mdash;as the latter seated himself by the
side of a low wall half buried in the drifted sand&mdash;the
fragment of some B.C. edifice&mdash;and partook of his frugal meat,
supper and dinner combined.
</p>

<p>
Far, far away in the distance Memphis and the Valley of
the Nile were lost in haze and obscurity; westward the sun,
like a ball of fire&mdash;a blood-red disc of enormous
proportions&mdash;shorn of every ray, was setting amid a sky of gold,
crimson, and soft apple-green, all blending through each other,
yet with light strong enough to send far along the waste
they had traversed the shadows of the two camels of Skene
and of Hassan.
</p>

<p>
The former recalled with a grim smile Moore's ballad:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Fly to the desert, fly with me!'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and thought the desert looked far from inviting.
</p>

<p>
His only table appurtenance was the jack-knife hung from
his neck by a lanyard, and as issued to all ranks of our
troops in Egypt, and with that he cut his sandwiches, now
dry indeed by this time, and opened a tiny tin of preserved
meat, which he washed down by a mouthful from the
hunting-flask, carried in his haversack.
</p>

<p>
As he sat alone eating his frugal meal, which from
religious scruples Hassan declined to share with him&mdash;or
indeed anything save a cigar&mdash;Skene, though neither a
sybarite nor a gourmand, could not help thinking regretfully
of the regimental mess-table in the citadel of Cairo,
possessing, like other such tables, all the ease of a kindly
family circle, without its probable dulness; of the dressing
bugle, and the merry drums and fifes playing the 'Roast
Beef of Old England;' the quiet weed after dinner, a stroke
at billiards, a rubber of short whist while holding good
cards; and just then civilization and all the good things of
this earth seemed very far off indeed!
</p>

<p>
When he and Hassan started again to reach the wells&mdash;where
they were to procure water for themselves and their
camels, and were to bivouac for the night, no trace of these
could be found, though the travellers wandered several miles
in different directions; and, as the sun set with tropical
rapidity, Skene&mdash;his water-bottle completely empty&mdash;with
his field-glass swept the horizon in vain for a sight of those
gum-trees which were said to indicate the locality of the
springs in question; and then he began more than ever to
mistrust the good faith, if not the knowledge, of Hassan
Abdullah.
</p>

<p>
So far as their camels were concerned, Skene had no cause
as yet for any anxiety, as these animals, besides the four
stomachs which all ruminating quadrupeds possess, have a
fifth, which serves as a reservoir for carrying a supply of
water in the parched and sandy deserts they are so often
obliged to traverse.
</p>

<p>
A well&mdash;one unknown to Hassan, apparently&mdash;they
certainly did come upon unexpectedly, but, alas! it was dry.
Malcolm Skene looked thirstily at the white stones that lined
or formed it, glistening in the light of the uprisen moon, and
with his tongue parched and lips hard and baked he thought
tantalizingly of brooks of cool and limpid water, of iced
champagne and bitter beer!
</p>

<p>
He haltered his camel, looked to his arms and laid them
half under him, and resting his head against the saddle of
his animal, strove to court sleep, against the labours of the
morrow, thinking the while that the labours of Sisyphus
were almost a joke to the toil of the duty he had
undertaken.
</p>

<p>
At a little distance on the other side of the dried-up
fountain, Hassan, whom he watched closely for a time, took
his repose in a similar fashion.
</p>

<p>
The night in the desert was not altogether unpleasant, for
that rarefied clearness of sky which renders the heat of the
sun so intolerable by day, makes the sky of night surpassingly
beautiful, and that is the time when, if he can, the
traveller should really make his way over the sandy waste.
</p>

<p>
With early morning, and while the red sun was yet below
the hazy horizon, came full awakening after a somewhat
restless night, broken by periods of watchfulness and
anxiety, and tantalized by dreams of flowing and sparkling
water, which left the pangs of growing thirst keener than
ever.
</p>

<p>
Hassan, however, seemed 'fresh as a daisy,' having, as
Malcolm strongly suspected, some secret store of his own
selfishly concealed about him.
</p>

<p>
They gave their camels a feed of their favourite food, the
twigs of some thorny mimosa that grew near the dried-up
well&mdash;scanty herbage of the desert&mdash;and then Malcolm, who
distrusted the skill or fealty, or both, of Hassan Abdullah,
while the latter was kneeling on his prayer carpet, turned to
consult his pocket compass with reference to the direction
in which to steer through the waste of sand which now
spread in every direction around them.
</p>

<p>
It was gone!
</p>

<p>
Nervously, with fingers that trembled in their haste, he
searched his haversack, turning out its few contents again
and again, and cast keen glances all around where he had
been overnight, but no sign or trace of that invaluable
instrument, on which too probably his life depended, was there!
</p>

<p>
Fiercely he turned to Hassan, then just ending his morning
prayer and folding up his carpet, suspecting that the soft
and swift-handed Egyptian must have filched it from him
during sleep&mdash;yet he had felt so wakeful that such could
scarcely be the case.
</p>

<p>
'My compass!' he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'What of it, <i>Yusbashi</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'Have you seen it?'
</p>

<p>
'I&mdash;not I; and if I did, do you think I would touch it?'
</p>

<p>
'It is <i>ifrit</i>&mdash;the work of the devil&mdash;an affair of which I,
as a true Mussulman, can know nothing.'
</p>

<p>
'But how about the way to go now?' said Malcolm Skene
in genuine perplexity and alarm, looking all around the
vicinity of the stony hole, called a well, for the twentieth time.
</p>

<p>
'The <i>Frenchi</i> will be told all of the way that his servant
knows,' replied Hassan with a profound salaam, while bending
his head to hide the leer of his stealthy and glittering
eyes.
</p>

<p>
Skene thought for a moment.  Should he take this fellow
at his word; threaten him with death if he did not produce
the pocket compass, or knock him down with the butt-end
of his pistol and then search his pockets?
</p>

<p>
An open quarrel was to be avoided.  Skene felt himself to
be a good deal, if not wholly, at the fellow's mercy.  The
latter could only delude him so far, at the risk of perilling
himself; but he might, on the other hand, lure and betray
him into the hands of the enemy, several of whom, under a
leader named Sheikh Moussa Abu Hagil, were hovering on
the skirts of the desert in various directions&mdash;a man known
to have been a faithful adherent and kinsmen of the captive
Zebehr Pasha.
</p>

<p>
Nothing seemed to remain for Skene but to accept as
before the guidance of Hassan Abdullah, so, after the latter
had breakfasted on a few dates and the former on a simple
ration from his haversack, once more they headed their
course into what seemed to be an endless and markless
waste of sand.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the bodily pangs of thirst, anger, doubt, and
anxiety were gathering in the mind of Malcolm; but he
sternly resolved that the moment he became assured of
Hassan Abdullah deluding or betraying him he would shoot
that copper-coloured individual dead, as if he were a reptile
or a wild beast.  And Hassan no doubt knew quite enough
of life in his own country to be aware that he rode on with
his life in his hands.
</p>

<p>
So another night and day passed away.
</p>

<p>
And now, as we have referred to the desert here and elsewhere
in the Soudan, it may seem the time to give a description
of what such a waste is, and the scene that now spread
before the anxious and bloodshot eyes of Malcolm Skene;
for it has been justly said that he who has never travelled
through such a place can form no idea of a locality so
wondrous&mdash;one in which all the ordinary conditions of
human life undergo a complete change.
</p>

<p>
Once away from the valley of the Nile, all between the
fourteenth degree and the shore of the Mediterranean, a
tract of more than eight hundred thousand square miles <i>is
desert</i>, treeless, waterless, without streams or rivulets, and
almost without wells, which, when they exist, are scanty, few,
and far apart.  'The first thing after reaching a well,' says a
recent writer, 'is to ascertain the quantity and quality of its
water.  As to the former, it may have been exhausted by a
preceding caravan, and hours may be required for a new
supply to ooze in again.  The quality of the desert water is
generally bad, the exception being when it becomes worse,
though long custom enables the Bedouins to drink water so
brackish as to be intolerable to all except themselves and
their flocks.  Well do I remember how at each well the
first skinful was tasted all round as epicures sip rare wines.
Great was the joy if it was pronounced <i>moya helwa</i>, "sweet
water;" but if the Bedouins said <i>moosh tayib</i>, "not good,"
we might be sure it was a solution of Epsom salts.'
</p>

<p>
The desert now traversed by Skene was composed of
coarse sand, abounding in some places with shells, pebbles,
and a species of salt.  In some parts the soil was shifting,
and so soft that the feet&mdash;even of his camel&mdash;sank into it
at every step; at others it was hard as beaten ground.  Here
and there grew a few patches of prickly plants, such as he
remembered to have seen in botanic gardens at home, with
small hillocks of drifted sand gathered round them; and as
he rode on he felt as if he had about him the awful sensations
of vastness, silence, and the sublimity of a calm and
waveless ocean&mdash;but an ocean of sand, arid, and gloomy,
dispiriting and suggestive of death&mdash;but to the European
only; as the Bedouins, whose native soil it is, are, beyond all
other nations and races, gay and cheerful.
</p>

<p>
During August and September the winds in Egypt retain
a northerly direction, and the weather is generally moderate;
but Malcolm Skene was in the desert now, and under the
peculiar influences of that peculiar region.
</p>

<p>
Then at times is to be encountered the mirage, or Spirit of
the Desert, as the Arabs call it, when the eyes of the
wanderer there are deluded by the seeming motion of distant
waves; of tall and graceful palms tossing feathery leaves in
the distance, when only the sun-scorched sand is lying,
mocking him with the false show of what his soul longs for,
and his overheated brain depicts in glowing colours.
</p>

<p>
Riding mechanically on&mdash;uncomfortably, too, all unused
as he was to the strange ambling action of a camel&mdash;oppressed
by thirst which he could see no means of quenching,
and knowing not when he might be able to do so&mdash;oppressed,
too, by the glare of a cloudless sun growing
hotter and hotter&mdash;more mighty than ever it seemed to be
before&mdash;Malcolm Skene was soon to become conscious that
the sense of vision was not the only one by which the
mysterious desert mocks its sojourner with fantastic tricks;
and once he became sensible of that strange and bewildering
phenomena referred to by the author of 'Eothen' in his
experiences of Eastern travel.
</p>

<p>
He seemed, overpowered by the heat, to fall slowly
asleep&mdash;was it for moments or minutes?&mdash;he knew not; but he
seemed also to be suddenly awakened by the familiar but
far-off sounds of drums beating, to the wailing of a bagpipe
playing 'The March of Lochiel,' as he had often heard it
played by the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, in the
citadel of Cairo.
</p>

<p>
He started and listened, his first idea being naturally that
he was partly under the power of a dream; but it seemed as
if minutes passed ere these sounds, in steady marching
cadence, became fainter and then died away.
</p>

<p>
Utterly bewildered, he was quite awake now.  Under the
same influence, and in the same place, it was the bells of his
native village that were heard by the writer referred to, and
who says: 'I attribute the effect to the great heat of the sun,
the perfect dryness of the clear air through which I moved,
and the deep stillness of all around me.  It seemed to me
that these causes, by occasioning a great tension and
susceptibility of the hearing organs, rendered them liable to
tingle under the passing touch of some new memory that
must have swept across my brain in a moment of sleep.'
</p>

<p>
And so doubtless it was with Malcolm Skene, who, sunk
in thought and lassitude, was pondering deeply over the
strange dream&mdash;if dream it was&mdash;when he was roused by the
voice of Hassan Abdullah, as it amounted to something like
a shriek.
</p>

<p>
'The <i>Zobisha</i>&mdash;the <i>Zobisha</i>!' he exclaimed, with a terror
that was too genuine to be affected in any way.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVI.
<br /><br />
ALONE!
</h3>

<p>
It was about noon, now, and with a start, roused from his
day-dream and half-apathy, Malcolm Skene looked about
him and saw that he had then to face one of the most
appalling, yet sublime, sights of the desert&mdash;a sand-storm&mdash;at
that season when the Egyptian winds approach the
Southern tropic, and they are more variable and tempestuous
than during any other season of the year&mdash;a state in
which they remain till February.
</p>

<p>
Distant about two miles, he suddenly saw the <i>Zobisha</i>, as
Hassan called it&mdash;several lofty pillars of sand travelling over
the waste with wondrous swiftness.  The tallest was vertical,
the others seemed to lean towards it, and, at the bases of all,
the sand rose as if lashed by a whirlwind into a raging sea,
amid which tough mimosa bushes were uprooted and swept
away like feathers.
</p>

<p>
The whirlwind subsided, but the mighty cloud of sand and
small pebbles which it had raised high in the darkened
heavens, almost to the zenith, continued to tower before the
two sojourners in the desert for more than an hour&mdash;purple,
dun, and yellow in hue at times, and anon all blended
together.
</p>

<p>
Brave though he was, a nameless dread such as he had
never felt before possessed the soul of Skene at a sight so
unusual and terrific; and there flashed upon his mind the
recollection of his letter to Hester, and how true his
presentiment seemed to be proving now, for he felt on the verge
of suffocation.
</p>

<p>
Hassan Abdullah, who in his prayers usually sighed for
the Paradise of the Prophet, with his seventy houris awaiting
him in their couches of hollow pearl, the fruits of the Tree
of Toaba, and springs of unlimited lemonade, now prayed
only for his own safety, while both their camels forgot their
usual docility, and became well nigh unmanageable with
terror.
</p>

<p>
The air was full of impalpable dust.  To avoid suffocation
or blindness therefrom, Skene dismounted, tied his
gauze pugaree tightly over his face, and placing his camel
between him and the skirt of the blast, which now developed
into a wind-storm, sweeping the column of sand with wondrous
speed before it, stooped his head close to the saddle
and held on to a stirrup-leather.
</p>

<p>
On came the wind-storm, and before he had time to
think, to express wonder to Hassan as to what it could be,
the tornado swept over the desert, carrying before it mimosa
bushes and cacti, clouds of shining pebbles, the withered
fragments of an old gum-tree, and the white bones of a dead
camel.
</p>

<p>
How his animal withstood the sharp and sweeping blast
that darkened all around them, Malcolm Skene knew not;
but he found his hands torn from the stirrup-leather, and
himself flung furiously and helplessly amid the sand, which
half covered him.
</p>

<p>
After a time, gasping, with his throat, nostrils, and ears
full of dust, he struggled to his feet and looked around him,
and saw, already far distant, the sand-cloud borne away by
the mighty wind, then in its wild career to some other quarter
of the desert.
</p>

<p>
Above him the sky was again cloudless; the air all still
and clear; the awful and angry rush of the wind-storm was
past.
</p>

<p>
But where was Hassan Abdullah?
</p>

<p>
A speck vanishing away in the far distance showed but too
plainly where he had gone with all the speed his camel could
achieve&mdash;a natural swiftness now accelerated by the
extremity of fear; and in another minute even that moving
speck disappeared, and Malcolm Skene found himself
alone&mdash;guideless and ignorant of which way to turn his steps in
the appalling solitude of the desert.
</p>

<p>
What was he to do now?
</p>

<p>
Follow in the route Hassan had taken, and which that
wily personage no doubt knew led to some haunt of men,
or abode of such civilization as existed there?
</p>

<p>
Even that he could not do.  The horizon showed no
point to indicate where the speck he knew to be Hassan
and his camel had vanished.
</p>

<p>
Malcolm's alarm for the future exceeded his just anger
and indignation for the present at this sudden and
unexpected desertion; but action of some kind became
necessary, and though apparently he could not be worse
off than where he was, every step he took might be
leading further from the path he should pursue to
Dayr-el-Syrian&mdash;further from a well or succour, and nearer to
'dusty death.'
</p>

<p>
After glancing at the trappings of his camel, he remounted
and rode forward slowly, fain to suck for a moment even a
hot pebble of the desert in hope to produce a little moisture
in his mouth, while consulting a small pocket map he possessed.
</p>

<p>
If Hassan had not misled him wilfully, and they had not
overshot the proper distance, to judge by the position of
the sun, he supposed that Dayr-el-Syrian, where the
Amir-Ali's command was encamped, should be somewhere on his
right; but, if so, ere this he should have come to the
sequestered Macarius Convent&mdash;so called from St. Macarius
the Elder, of Egypt, a shepherd of the fourth century, who
(so runs the story) dwelt for sixty years in the desert; but
of that edifice he saw no sign or vestige, and he saw, by
the same map, that if he had <i>passed</i> it and gone through the
extreme end of the Wady Faregh, then before him must lie
the 'Petrified Forest,' of which he knew nothing, and of
which he had never heard before, lying apparently more
than a hundred miles westward of Cairo&mdash;a distance which
it seemed almost incredible he had so nearly travelled, and
the very name of which was suggestive of something of
horror and dismay.
</p>

<p>
Again and again, with hollow and haggard eyes, he swept
the desert through his field-glass, seeking to note a bush or
tree that might indicate where a fountain lay; but in vain,
and the pangs of thirst increased till they became gnawing
and maddening.
</p>

<p>
He would certainly die soon!
</p>

<p>
More than once he looked, too, in the desperate hope of
seeing Abdullah returning; but equally in vain.
</p>

<p>
As he rode on under the scorching sun&mdash;scorching even
while setting&mdash;with his head nodding on his breast through
weakness, there came before him day-dreams of runnels of
gushing water&mdash;their very sound seemed to be in his ears&mdash;of
'a wee burnie wimpling under the lang yellow broom,' in
the shady woods of Dunnimarle, and the rustle of their
leaves seemed overhead!
</p>

<p>
The poor old mother there, to whom he was as the apple
of her eye&mdash;Hester too&mdash;would never know of all he endured
and would have to endure inexorably till the bitter end
came; and just then, more than even his mother, dove-eyed
Hester Maule seemed all the world to him!
</p>

<p>
Well&mdash;'Time and the hour run through the roughest day.'
</p>

<p>
With that appreciation of trifles peculiar to us all in
moments of dire perplexity or intense excitement, he was
remarking the vast length of shadow thrown across the
level waste, by the light of the now nearly level sun&mdash;the
shadow of himself and his camel&mdash;when a sudden acceleration
in the speed of the latter attracted his attention; it
began to glide over the desert sand more swiftly than ever,
guided by some instinct implanted in it by nature, and in a
few minutes it brought him to a little spot of green&mdash;an
oasis&mdash;amid which, fenced round by stones and large pebbles,
lay a pool of water!
</p>

<p>
'A well&mdash;a well&mdash;water&mdash;water at last!' exclaimed Skene
with a prayer on his lips, as he threw himself beside it.
Forgetting thoughts of all and everything, past and future,
in the mingled agony and joy of the present, he crawled
towards it on hands and knees, tossed aside his tropical
helmet and drank of it deeply, thirstily, greedily, laving his
face and hands in it often, and he was not sure that his
tears did not mingle with the water as he did so&mdash;tears of
gratitude.
</p>

<p>
By nature and its physical formation, less athirst than his
rider, the camel drank of the pool too, but scantily.  Skene
then filled his water-bottle with the precious liquid, as if he
feared the well might dry up, even as he watched it; and
then (after tethering his camel) he stretched himself beside
it, and, utterly worn out by all he had undergone in mind
and body, fell into a deep and dreamless slumber,
undisturbed alike by flies or mosquitoes.
</p>

<p>
How long he slept thus he knew not, but day had not
broken, and the waning moon was shining brightly when he
awoke.  He was already too much of a soldier to feel
surprise on awaking in a strange bed or place; but some of his
surroundings there were sufficiently strange to startle him
into instant wakefulness and activity.
</p>

<p>
'It is the Frenchi&mdash;the Infidel!' he heard the voice of
Hassan exclaim, and he found himself surrounded by a
crowd of armed Arabs, foremost among whom stood Pietro
Girolamo&mdash;the rascally Girolamo of Cairo, who, having
made even that city too hot to hold him, had, for the time,
sought refuge with the denizens of the desert.
</p>

<p>
Partly clad and partly nude, with plaited hair, forms of
bronze colour, their teeth and eyes gleaming bright as the
swords and spears with which they were armed, Malcolm
Skene saw some twenty or more Soudanese warriors, on foot
or camel-back, around him, and gave himself up for lost
indeed, as his sword and revolver were immediately torn
from him.
</p>

<p>
Uttering a yell, Girolamo was rushing upon him with
upraised knife, when he was roughly thrust back by a tall and
towering Arab, who dealt him a sharp blow with the butt-end
of his Remington rifle&mdash;so much as to say, 'I command
here.'
</p>

<p>
Clearly seen and defined in the light of a moon which
was silvery, yet brilliant as that of day, Skene saw before
him in this personage an Arab of the Arabs.
</p>

<p>
His bronzed face was nearly black by nature and exposure
to the scorching tropical sun.  His arms, legs, and neck
were bare, and their muscles stood forth like whipcord.
His nose was somewhat hawk-like; his eyes were keen as
those of a mountain eagle, and his shark-like teeth were
white as ivory, in contrast to the skin of his leathern
visage.
</p>

<p>
His hair, which flowed under a steel cap furnished with a
nasal bar, was black as night, and shone with an unguent
made from crocodile fat by the fishers of Dongola; and
save for his shirt of Dharfour steel and Mahdi tunic and
trousers, he looked like a mummy of the Pharaohs
resuscitated and inspired by a devil.
</p>

<p>
His arms were a long cross-hilted sword, a dagger, and a
Remington rifle.
</p>

<p>
Such was the Sheikh Moussa Abu Hagil, kinsman of
Zebehr Pasha&mdash;like Zebehr, almost the last of the great
slave-dealers&mdash;and whose prisoner Malcolm Skene now
found himself&mdash;whether for good or for evil, he could not
foresee; but his heart too painfully foreboded the <i>latter</i>!
</p>

<p>
'Sheikh,' said he, 'you will consider me as a prisoner of
war, I trust?'
</p>

<p>
'We shall see&mdash;there are things that are as bad as death,
and yet are not death,' was the grim and enigmatical reply
of Moussa Abu Hagil, which Skene knew referred to torture
or mutilation, by having his hands struck off, like those of
some prisoners he had seen.
</p>

<p>
For many a day after, the friends of Malcolm Skene
searched the public prints in vain for further tidings of him
than we have given three chapters back.
</p>

<p>
Applications to the War Office and telegrams to headquarters
at Cairo were alike unavailing, and received only
the same cold, stereotyped answer&mdash;that nothing was known
of the fate of Captain Malcolm Skene but what the news
papers contained.
</p>

<p>
His supposed fate and story were deemed as parallel with
the Palmer tragedy on the shore of the Red Sea; but more
especially with that of his countryman, Captain Gordon, an
enthusiastic soldier, who, missing Colonel Burnaby's party
which he was to accompany with the desert column,
perished in the wilderness, far from the Gakdul track&mdash;but
whether at the hands of the Arabs, or by the horrors of
thirst, was never known.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVII.
<br /><br />
THE FIRST QUARREL.
</h3>

<p>
In his anxiety to leave Earlshaugh, Roland writhed under
his convalescence, thus retarding in no small degree his
complete recovery, and keeping him chained to a sofa in his
sitting-room, when otherwise he might have been abroad in
the grounds, though the brown foliage and the falling leaves,
with the piping of the autumn winds, were not calculated
much to raise the spirits of the ailing.
</p>

<p>
The partridges had become wild; the pheasants were still
in splendid order, and cub-hunting was beginning in those
districts where it was in vogue; but no one in Earlshaugh
House thought of any of these, yet cub-hunting, as an
earnest of the coming season, had been one of Roland
Lindsay's delights.
</p>

<p>
However, he had other more serious and bitter things to
think of now; and for cub-hunting or fox-hunting, never
again would he set out from Earlshaugh and feel the joyous
enthusiasm roused by seeing the hounds 'feathering' down
a furrowed field with all their heads in the air, or find
himself crossing the fertile and breezy Howe of Fife, from
meadow to meadow, and field to field, over burns, hedges,
and five-foot drystone dykes, then standing erect in his
stirrups and galloping as if for life after the streaming pack,
as they swept over 'the Muirs of Fife' which merge in the
rich and extensive plains of the famous East Neuk.
</p>

<p>
Hunt he might elsewhere in the future, but never again
where he and his fathers before him had hunted for generations,
though Mr. Hawkey Sharpe was then actually doing
so, and with horses from 'his sister's' stables at Earlshaugh!
</p>

<p>
During this period of convalescence and enforced idleness
Roland became conscious of a kind of change&mdash;subtle
and undefinable&mdash;in Annot.  She&mdash;in a spirit of maidenly
reserve&mdash;was apparently in no hurry for the completion of
arrangements about their marriage.
</p>

<p>
She left all these <i>pro tem.</i> in the hands of 'mamma' in
South Belgravia; and the old lady's letters&mdash;changed in
tone&mdash;were full of suggested delays, doubts, and difficulties in
finally fixing a period to her daughter's engagement with
Roland; the said letters, of course, bearing on the
all-important matter of settlements, which&mdash;as circumstances now
stood at Earlshaugh&mdash;he was utterly at a loss how to make
without the advice, more than ever, of the family agent, old
Mr. M'Wadsett of Thistle Court.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, full of themselves and their own affairs, and
of their marriage, which was now fixed for an early day, and
before Jack Elliot's return to Egypt, Maude and the latter
were less observant than Hester of what transpired at
Earlshaugh during Roland's convalescence.
</p>

<p>
Attended by old Buckle, Annot had gone to see the
hounds throw off, and in following the field for some little
way contrived to lose her venerable groom, whom no doubt
she deemed a bore; and while he was searching for her
hopelessly over a Fifeshire muir she came home to one of
the park gates attended by a gentleman in hunting costume,
with whom she seemed on pretty intimate terms&mdash;a
circumstance which, when mentioned, she laughingly
explained away.
</p>

<p>
But at a subsequent period she was seen by Maude and
Hester riding in the park with one supposed to be the same
stranger, but at a considerable distance.
</p>

<p>
The two girls could see that the pair were going slowly
together&mdash;perhaps their cattle were tired, but, as Maude
said, that was no reason why they should ride so near each
other that his right hand could rest on her saddle-bow.
</p>

<p>
'Who is he?  I don't like this,' said Maude.
</p>

<p>
But Hester remained silent and full of her own thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Other meetings between these two became whispered
about, rather intangibly, however, and then rumour gave the
gentleman the name of Hoyle.
</p>

<p>
'Hoyle?' thought Hester, and she remembered Annot's
confidence about her Belgravian admirer, 'the Detrimental'
Bob Hoyle.
</p>

<p>
Annot blushed deeply and painfully with a suffusion that
dyed her snowy neck and face to the temples, and which
was some time in passing away, when questioned on this
matter by Maude, who she knew mistrusted her, and
falteringly she asked:
</p>

<p>
'How did you learn his name?'
</p>

<p>
'It dropped from you incidentally when speaking to
Elliot.'
</p>

<p>
'Did it?' said she, with a pallid lip.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, when hunting, at a house in the neighbourhood.'
</p>

<p>
'I&mdash;I know no one&mdash;I mean no harm&mdash;and Roland cannot
ride to hounds just now,' urged Annot, a little piteously,
and adopting her child-like manner.
</p>

<p>
'Then neither should you, Annot.'
</p>

<p>
'I will do so no more, Maude&mdash;and I give you my word,'
she added emphatically, and with an air of perfect candour,
'that I shall never again see Mr. Hoyle!'
</p>

<p>
Then Maude kissed her, but, as she did so, it scarcely
required so close an observer as Hester to detect the actual
dislike&mdash;all sweet and lovely as her face was&mdash;that lurked
under her cousin's affected cordiality.
</p>

<p>
But the latter's indignation returned when the pledge was
broken.
</p>

<p>
Deeming all this most unfair to Roland, his sunny-haired
sister consulted with Hester, but that young lady nervously
declined to involve herself in the matter, though Roland
nearly took the initiative one day (when Hester was
arranging some fresh flowers in his room) with reference to
Annot's now frequent absences and seeming neglect of
him.
</p>

<p>
'Does the dear girl shrink from me, Hester,' said he,
'because I am pale and thin&mdash;wasted and feeble&mdash;after that
cursed accident?'
</p>

<p>
'Surely not, Roland!'
</p>

<p>
'It seems very like it, by Jove!' he grumbled almost to
himself.
</p>

<p>
In the dark violet eyes of Hester there shone at that
moment, as she bent over the flower-vases, a strange
light&mdash;the light that is born of mingled anger and love.
</p>

<p>
Maude thought it very strange that in all reports of the
meets, hunting and county packs, etc., the name of
Mr. Hoyle never appeared among others, nor were her
suspicions allayed by the idea of Jack Elliot, that 'he was
probably a duffer whose name was not worth mentioning.'
</p>

<p>
But gossip was busy, and Roland's loving and tender
sister's complaints of Annot seemed to become the echo of
his own secret and growing thoughts, which rose unpleasantly
now on Annot's protracted absences from his society,
and a new and undefinable something in her manner that, in
short, he did not like.
</p>

<p>
The half-uttered hints of Maude&mdash;uttered painfully and
reluctantly, trembling lest she should become a
mischief-maker&mdash;stung him deeply, more deeply than he cared to
admit.
</p>

<p>
'What has Annot done now?' he asked on one occasion,
tossing on his sofa and flinging away a half-smoked cigar.
'It seems to me that if a woman is popular with our sex she
becomes intensely the reverse with her own.'
</p>

<p>
'Roland,' urged Maude, 'you are unnecessarily severe,
on me at least.'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;perhaps the atmosphere of this place is corrupting
her; I don't wonder if it is so; we live here in one of
deceit,' said he bitterly.  'Poor little Maude,' he added
more gently, 'home is no longer home to you now.'
</p>

<p>
'I shall soon have another,' said Maude, with brightness
dancing in her eyes of forget-me-not blue.
</p>

<p>
'Bui I must have this matter out with Annot&mdash;ask her to
come to me.'
</p>

<p>
And when Annot came, with all her strange and flower-like
fairness of colour and willowy grace, how fragile, soft,
and <i>petite</i> she looked, with her minute little face and wealth of
golden hair, her bright inquiring eyes, their expression just
then having something of alarm mingled with coyness in
them!
</p>

<p>
How could he be angry with her?  What was he to
say&mdash;how to begin?
</p>

<p>
We say there was alarm in her expression, for she saw
near Roland's hand his powerful field-glasses, with which he
was in the habit of amusing himself in viewing the far
stretch of country extending away to the distant hills.  He
could also view the park, which was much nearer.
</p>

<p>
She knew not <i>whom</i> he might have seen there, and the
little colour she had died away.
</p>

<p>
'What is it, Roland?' she asked; 'you wish to speak
with me.'
</p>

<p>
How terrible it is, says someone, to confront direct and
apparently frank people!  'To state in precise terms the
offences of all those who incur our displeasure would
occasion a good deal of humming and hawing, and, it is to
be feared, invention on the part of most of us in the course
of twelve months.  We have wrought ourselves up to
the pitch of a very pretty quarrel, and it is dreadfully
embarrassing to be called upon to state our grounds
for it.'
</p>

<p>
So it was with Roland.  He had worked himself up to a
point which he failed just then to sustain, while in her
manner there was a curious mixture of the caressing and the
defiant; but when she tried some of her infantile and clinging
ways, Roland became cold and hard in the expression of
his mouth and eyes, though she hastened to adjust the
sofa-cushion on which his head reclined.
</p>

<p>
'You wish to speak with me, Maude said,' remarked
Annot, in a low voice, while looking down and somewhat
nervously adjusting a flower in her girdle.
</p>

<p>
Roland did not reply at once.  She eyed him furtively,
and then laughed.
</p>

<p>
'I do not understand your mirth,' said he coldly.
</p>

<p>
'Nor I your gloom, Roland dear; but then you are far
from well.'
</p>

<p>
He sighed, as if deprecating her manner.
</p>

<p>
'Am I to be scolded, like a naughty child?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'You seem to feel that you deserve it.'
</p>

<p>
'But I won't be scolded&mdash;and for what?'
</p>

<p>
'Acting as you ought not to do.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'Riding to see the hounds throw off, without my
knowledge, and escorted only by an old groom, whose place
another has taken more than once.'
</p>

<p>
He paused, loth to say more.  His proud soul revolted
at the idea of being jealous&mdash;vulgarly, grotesquely jealous
of anyone; yet he eyed her with pain and anger
mingled.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, you refer to Bob Hoyle&mdash;poor Bob!  Hester
knows about him,' said Annot, after a little pause, in
which she grew, if possible, paler, and certainly more
confused.
</p>

<p>
'He is not a visitor here&mdash;and yet you have been seen
with him in the park and lawn.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.  Can I be less than polite when he escorted me
home from the meet&mdash;in the dusk, too?'
</p>

<p>
'And who the deuce is Bob Hoyle?'
</p>

<p>
'I have mentioned him to Hester,' replied Annot, still
evasively.
</p>

<p>
'But who is he visiting in this locality?'
</p>

<p>
'I do not know.'
</p>

<p>
'Not know&mdash;how?'
</p>

<p>
'Simply because I never asked him.'
</p>

<p>
'Strange!'
</p>

<p>
'Not at all, Roland dear, when I think and care so little
about him.'
</p>

<p>
She tried a tiny caress, but he turned from her,
embittered and humiliated.
</p>

<p>
Disappointment, shame, sorrow, and mortification were
all gathering in his heart, as doubts of Annot grew there too;
and in his then weak and nervous state he actually trembled
to pursue a subject so obnoxious.  Was it to be the old
story;
</p>

<p class="poem"> 
  'Of one that loved, not wisely, but too well;<br />
  Of one not easily jealous, but, being wrought,<br />
  Perplexed in the extreme.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A little silence ensued, during which, as he looked upon
her in all her fair beauty, so unstable of purpose, and so
humble in heart is one who loves truly that he felt inclined
to throw himself upon her affection for him, and only
beseech her to be careful.
</p>

<p>
She was&mdash;he thought&mdash;young, artless, rash, and perhaps
knew not how unseemly, especially in a censorious country
place, were these mistakes of hers.  But her manner
repelled him.  The half-grown sensation of softness died
away, and irritation came instead.  So he said bluntly:
</p>

<p>
'Annot, I tell you plainly that there must be no more of
this sort of thing.'
</p>

<p>
Her usually sweet little lips curled defiantly, and she
eyed him inquiringly now.
</p>

<p>
'Dare you try to make me believe that what you admit
is all that has occurred?'
</p>

<p>
'I do not wish to try and make you believe anything,' she
replied sullenly, yet in a broken tone.
</p>

<p>
'This is worse and worse,' said Roland in a husky voice.
</p>

<p>
'Are you jealous of him?' she asked, with a laugh that
had no mirth in it.  'Surely not; he is but a boy.'
</p>

<p>
'I am, and shall be, jealous of no one, Annot!'
</p>

<p>
'He speaks to me; it is not my fault&mdash;and is always
polite.  Do not let us squabble, dearest Roland&mdash;I do so
hate squabbling,' said she, selecting a white bud from
among the flowers at her waist and pinning it in his
hole; but Roland's blood was too much up to be
propitiated by a white bud, so Annot had recourse to a few
tears; but, so far from there being peace between them,
matters waxed more unpleasant still.
</p>

<p>
'Why has this Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;Hoyle&mdash;as you name him,
never called here, nor left even a card?'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot tell.'
</p>

<p>
Yet he is an old London friend, and has come almost
to the house door!'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot tell,' repeated Annot.
</p>

<p>
'Ycu have met him on the skirts of the park?'
</p>

<p>
'By the merest chance.'
</p>

<p>
'These chances would seem to have occurred too often,'
interrupted Roland, greatly ruffled now, yet feeling sick at
heart; 'so let us come to an end!'
</p>

<p>
'By&mdash;by parting?' she asked, with pale lips.
</p>

<p>
'It is easily done; I am going back to the regiment in a
little time, and gossips will soon cease to link my name with
yours, when you&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'How cruel of you, Roland!' she said, and she looked at
him entreatingly for a moment with her small hands clasped,
and then turned away her face.
</p>

<p>
'It may be merely flirtation or folly that inspires you;
but beware, Annot, how you treat me thus, and remember
that lovers' quarrels are not <i>always</i> love renewed.'
</p>

<p>
He felt and feared that a gulf which might never be
bridged over was widening suddenly between them.  Had
she asked him just then, with all his anger, to kiss her once
and forgive her, he would have yielded too probably; but
the little beauty, all unlike her usually pliant, soft, and
clinging self, held haughtily aloof and said:
</p>

<p>
'Am I to give you back your ring, and relinquish all that
it involves?'
</p>

<p>
'No, Annot, no, no,' exclaimed Roland, not yet prepared
for such a climax.
</p>

<p>
With an angry sob in her slender throat she tried to twist
it off, but in vain; and they regarded each other with a
curiously mingled expression which they never forgot&mdash;he
sorrowfully and indignantly; she saucily and defiantly.
</p>

<p>
'Have you anything more unpleasant to say to me,
Roland?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'Only that I begin to wish, Annot&mdash;oh, my God&mdash;that
we had never, never met!'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!  Good-bye.'
</p>

<p>
'Good-bye.'
</p>

<p>
She swept away.  What a change&mdash;was it witchcraft?&mdash;had
come ever the once playful, childlike, and winning little
Annot!  Roland's heart was sick and crushed, and he began
to have a growing and unpleasant suspicion that he had
made, as he thought, 'a confounded fool of himself.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank Heaven, Hester!  I shall soon have the sea rolling
between me and this place,' said he, when, after a time, he
told his cousin, the early playmate and sweetheart of other
days, the story of this interview and his complaint against
Annot.  'Regrets are useless; we cannot change the past;
but I have neither the inclination nor the capacity to face all
the circumstances that seem to surround me in Earlshaugh
now.'
</p>

<p>
'Why has he addressed me in his distress, and on this
subject?' thought Hester almost angrily; 'how can I
sympathize with him in the matter?  And he comes to me at a
time, too, when I know we may be soon parted for ever, and
when my thoughts are as full of him as they were in that old
time that can return no more.'
</p>

<p>
Piqued at and disappointed with Annot, a curious and
confusing emotion came more than once into the mind of
Roland&mdash;one described by a Scottish writer as feeling 'that
had he not, and had he been, and if he could he might&mdash;in
line, he thought the medley which many a man thinks when
he knows that he loves one, and only <i>one</i>; but under suasion
and pressure would find it just possible to yield to <i>other</i>
distractions.'
</p>

<p>
Annot did not afford him many opportunities of recurring
to their first quarrel or effacing its memory; and from that
hour she kept indignantly and sullenly aloof, as much as she
could in courtesy do, from Maude and Hester&mdash;to their
surprise&mdash;spending most of her time in the apartments and
society of Mrs. Lindsay.
</p>

<p>
But once again, in the long shady avenue near the Weird
Yett, when Maude was idling there, under the cold blue sky
of an October evening, with Jack Elliot&mdash;idling in the
happiness a girl feels when on the brink of her marriage
with the man she loves with all the strength of her warm
heart&mdash;the man whose voice and the mere touch of whose hand
gives joy&mdash;she felt that heart turn cold when she detected
Annot&mdash;her brother's <i>fiancée</i>&mdash;bidding a hasty adieu to the
stranger before referred to&mdash;clad in a red hunting coat, and
leading his horse by the bridle.
</p>

<p>
So a crisis of some kind was surely at hand now!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap38"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
<br /><br />
THE CRISIS.
</h3>

<p>
What did, or what could, Annot mean by this studied
duplicity and defiance of propriety? thought Maude; but
ere she could reflect much on the subject, or consider how
to speak to Roland about it, or whether she should simply
let him discover more for himself, the crisis referred to in
our last chapter came to pass, and the possible '<i>other</i>
distractions' that had occurred, in his irritation, to Roland's
mind were forgotten by him then.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding what had passed between them, the
charm of Annot's manner, her graceful and piquant ways,
impelled or allured him again, and his passionate love for
her swelled up at times in his breast.  Was he not to make
one more effort, or was it too late to win her love again?
</p>

<p>
Like one who when drowning will cling to a straw,
Roland, with all his just indignation at Annot, clung to his
faith in her; but they had parted with much apparent
coldness; and, as we have said, in that huge old rambling
mansion of Earlshaugh, as it was easy for people to avoid
each other it they wished to do so, he had not again met
her alone.
</p>

<p>
Thus any explanation was deferred, and, with all his love,
he felt painfully that if he once began fully to doubt her and
surrendered himself to that idea, all would be lost; and yet
he had little cause for confidence now, apparently.
</p>

<p>
From her own lips again he resolved&mdash;however galling to
his pride&mdash;to hear his fate, of her wishes and of her love, if
the latter still was his; and thus he asked her by note to
meet him in the library, at a time when they were sure to be
undisturbed, as Mrs. Lindsay was usually indisposed at the
hour he selected, and Maude, Jack, and Hester would be,
he knew, absent riding.
</p>

<p>
From his own lips Annot had been fully informed of how
his father's will was framed, but her ambition went far beyond
that of Becky Sharp when the latter thought she would be
a good woman on five thousand a year, would not miss a
little soup for the poor out of that sum, and could pay
everybody when she had it.
</p>

<p>
Annot, though apparently passive no longer, feigned a
desire to continue 'the entanglement,' for such she deemed
it&mdash;this engagement to Roland, begun at Merlwood.  She
had a secret gratitude for the information that had come to
her in time of his future prospects.  She could have
continued to love him after a fashion of her own, and perhaps
as much as it was in her selfish nature to love anyone; but
it must be as proprietor of Earlshaugh, of which she had an
overweening desire to be mistress, and, moreover, she never
meant to form or face 'a moneyless marriage.'
</p>

<p>
And now in this meeting with Roland she felt that a
crisis in her fate had come; that the sooner it was over and
done with the better; and with a power of will beyond what
anyone could have conceived a girl so soft and fair, so
small in stature and lovely in feature might possess, she kept
her appointment; but, without referring even to Lucrezia
Borgia, who was a golden-haired little creature, with a feeble
and vapid expression of face (as Mrs. Jameson tells us),
does not history record how often fair little women have
been possessed of iron will and nature?
</p>

<p>
Annot accorded her soft cheek to Roland's lip so coldly
that he scarcely touched it!
</p>

<p>
Both looked pale, though they stood, when regarding each
other, in the red light of the October sunset, that streamed
like a crimson flood through a deeply embayed old window
near them.
</p>

<p>
Annot wore a dark dress, and round her slender throat a
high ruffle of black lace, which, like the jet drops in her
tiny ears, enhanced the marvellous fairness of her skin, as
Roland remarked, for even such trifling details failed to
escape him in that time of doubt and exceeding misery.
</p>

<p>
'You have not kept me waiting,' said she with a smile,
and as if feeling a dire necessity for saying something.
</p>

<p>
'Was it likely I should do so, Annot, when I have
counted every moment of time since I sent my little note to
you?' replied Roland, feeling instinctively from what he
saw in her eye and manner that the dreaded time had
come!
</p>

<p>
'How silly&mdash;useless I mean, such impatience, when we
meet daily somewhere&mdash;at meals and so forth!' said she,
looking out upon the far expanse of green park, steeped in
the hazy sunshine of one of the hot evenings of October.
</p>

<p>
'Annot,' said Roland impatiently, and striking a heel on
the floor as he spoke, 'after what passed between us last&mdash;a
conversation alike distasteful and painful&mdash;I can no longer
endure the suspense, the agony your conduct and bearing
cause me.  Do you really wish all to be at end between us?'
</p>

<p>
His eyes were bent eagerly upon her face, the muscles
of which certainly quivered with emotion&mdash;either love or
shame, he knew not which&mdash;and he took her hands in his,
but relinquished them; his own were hot and trembling as
if he had an ague, white hers were firm and cold as they
were white and beautiful.
</p>

<p>
'It was a joke&mdash;a petulant joke, your proposal to give
me back your ring and break our engagement&mdash;was it not,
darling?' he asked after a brief pause.
</p>

<p>
'It was <i>no</i> joke,' replied Annot, with still averted eyes, in
which, however, there was not a vestige of those sympathetic
tears, which, fur effect, she had usually so near the surface
on trivial occasions; 'it cost me much to utter the few
words I said&mdash;but I meant them.'
</p>

<p>
'You did?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;Roland.'
</p>

<p>
'And that was to be your only reply to my remonstrances?'
</p>

<p>
'Made as these remonstrances were&mdash;yes.  You are too
exacting, Roland; and&mdash;and&mdash;' she added with a bluntness
that jarred on his ear, 'it is so tiresome being long engaged,
mamma says.'
</p>

<p>
'I am sorry you quote her; but we can end it without an
unseemly quarrel, surely.'
</p>

<p>
She shook her head, and all her hair shone like a golden
aureole in the sunlight; and with all his just anger Roland
looked at her as if his mind were leaving him.
</p>

<p>
'In short, mamma also says&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Mamma again!&mdash;says what?'
</p>

<p>
'That we are evidently unsuited for each other.'
</p>

<p>
'When did she discover this?  Her letters to me have
never breathed a suspicion of it.'
</p>

<p>
Annot did not reply, but continued to trace the pattern
of the carpet with a foot like that of Cinderella.
</p>

<p>
'When did she adopt this new view?' asked Roland,
almost sternly.
</p>

<p>
'Recently, I suppose.'
</p>

<p>
'We know our own minds, surely, so what can her
capricious ideas matter to us?  If you love me, Annot,
they can make no difference.'
</p>

<p>
She only winced a little, and averted her face still more,
as if she dared not meet his dark, earnest, and inquiring
eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Speak!' he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'Women change their minds often, it is said&mdash;why may
not I, by advice?'
</p>

<p>
'God keep me, Annot!  Then the change is with yourself?
Has our past, so far as you are concerned, been all
duplicity and falsehood?'
</p>

<p>
'As when last we spoke on this matter, your language is
unpleasant, Roland,' said Annot, as if seeking a cause for
indignation or complaint.
</p>

<p>
'Is this a time to mince matters?  Surely you loved me?'
</p>

<p>
'You&mdash;you were so fond of me, that I could not help
liking you in return, Roland,' said she, trembling and
confusedly; 'we were thrown so much together, and&mdash;and you
see&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'That I have been befooled!' he interrupted her with
bitterness and a gust of anger.
</p>

<p>
'Do not use such a rough expression,' said she, recovering
herself; 'and please don't allow listeners to think we are
rehearsing for amateur theatricals.'
</p>

<p>
For a moment concentrated fury flashed in Roland's dark
eyes.
</p>

<p>
Then he regarded her wistfully again, and his gust of
anger gave way to an emotion of infinite tenderness.
</p>

<p>
'Annot,' he exclaimed, caressing her hands, on which,
truth to tell, his hot tears dropped.  'Oh, my darling, tell
me that you do not mean all this&mdash;that you are not in cruel
earnest and oblivious of all the past.'
</p>

<p>
'I never loved you&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Never loved me?' said he hoarsely,
</p>

<p>
'As you wished to be; it was to serve my own ends&mdash;my
own purpose that I simulated&mdash;then&mdash;so hate me if you
can!'
</p>

<p>
'Hate you,' he faltered, utterly crushed and bewildered
by her words.  His eyes were lurid now, for anger again
mingled with love in them.  'Surely this is all some bad
dream, from which I must awaken.'
</p>

<p>
'It is no dream,' said Annot, turning with an unsteady
step as if she would pass him; but he barred her way.
</p>

<p>
'Do you mean that you loved some one else?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'Do not ask me.'
</p>

<p>
'I have the right to do so!'
</p>

<p>
'No, Roland&mdash;you have not.'
</p>

<p>
'You surely did at one time love me, Annot, or your
duplicity is monstrous, till&mdash;till this fellow Hoyle came
upon the tapis?  Was it not so?' he asked, almost piteously,
for his moods varied quickly.
</p>

<p>
'Not quite; and I can't be poor, that is the plain English
of it; I can't be a struggling man's wife, as I now know
yours must be, as Earlshaugh&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Belongs to another, and not to me, you mean?'
</p>

<p>
She was silent.  Selfish though she was to the heart's
core, a blush crossed her cheek, a genuine blush of shame
at her own blunt openness, and it was but too evident
that she had schooled herself for all this&mdash;had screwed her
courage to the sticking point.
</p>

<p>
'Then I have only been a cat's-paw, and you have loved,
if it is in your nature to love, another all the time?' said
Roland hoarsely, as he drew back a pace with something of
horror and disgust in his face now.
</p>

<p>
Almost pitifully did this cruel girl regard his face, which
had become ashy gray, the wounded and despairing love he
felt for her passing away from his eyes, while his figure, she
could not but admit, was straight, handsome, and proud in
bearing as ever, when compared with that of the <i>other</i>, who
was in her mind now.
</p>

<p>
'All is over, then, and there is no need to torture or
humiliate me further,' said he.
</p>

<p>
'All is over&mdash;yes,' she replied, with a real or affected
sob; 'and you will, I hope, bless the day when I left you
free to win a richer bride than I am, Roland.  Forgive me,
and let us part friends.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Friends!</i>' he exclaimed, in a low voice of reproach,
bitterness, and rage curiously mingled.
</p>

<p>
Resolute to act out the scene to the last detail, she slowly
drew her engagement ring off her finger&mdash;like the marriage
ring, the woman's badge of servitude according to the old
English idea, but of eternity with every other people, past
or present&mdash;laid it on a table near him, and gliding away
without another word or glance, they separated, and Roland
stood for a minute or so as if turned to stone.
</p>

<p>
Then, like one in a dream, he found himself walking
slowly to and fro, forgetful even of his temporary lameness,
on the terraced path beneath the towering walls of the old
house.
</p>

<p>
The engagement ring&mdash;how tiny it looked!&mdash;was in his
hand, and with something like a malediction he tossed it
into a sheet of deep ornamental water that lay thereby, and
there too, perhaps, he would have tossed all the other
beautiful and valuable presents he had given her; but these
the fair Annot did not as yet see her way to returning, and,
sooth to say, he never thought of them.
</p>

<p>
So&mdash;so he was 'thrown over' for one who seemed most
suddenly and unaccountably to have come upon the tapis,
but chiefly because he was a kind of outcast&mdash;a disinherited
man.  Had she not told him so in the plainest language?
</p>

<p>
The situation was a grotesquely humiliating one.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, to be well and strong and fit to march again!' he sighed.
</p>

<p>
In the expression of his dark eyes there was now much of
the bitterness, keenness, and longing of a prisoner looking
round the cell which he loathed, and from which he desired
to be gone; and more than once, in the solitude of his
room, he closed his eyes and rested his head upon his arms,
as if he wished to see and hear of his then surroundings
no more.
</p>

<p>
Even the caresses of Maude&mdash;even Hester's gentle voice
and soft touch failed to rouse him for a time.
</p>

<p>
Some days elapsed before Roland&mdash;after thinking over
again and again all the details of this most singular episode,
the strangest <i>crisis</i> in his life&mdash;could realize that it was not
all a dream, and that the relations between himself and
Annot had undergone such a complete revolution that their
paths in life must lie apart for ever, now.
</p>

<p>
But he was yet to learn the more bitter sequel to all
this.
</p>

<p>
Roland naturally thought that as the doctors would
scarcely yet permit him to quit Earlshaugh and travel, now
Annot Drummond would take her departure to Merlwood or
London; but this she did not do, and seemed, with intense
bad taste, to adopt the rôle of being his stepmother's guest,
while sedulously avoiding him, so he began to make his
arrangements for decamping without delay.
</p>

<p>
In bidding adieu, out of mere courtesy to Mrs. Lindsay,
Roland never referred to the existence of Annot.
Neither did she.
</p>

<p>
Was this good feeling, or was she endorsing the new
situation adopted by Annot?
</p>

<p>
He cared not to canvass the matter even in his own mind;
but ere he quitted Earlshaugh he was yet, we have said, to
learn the sequel to all this.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIX.
<br /><br />
TURNING THE TABLES.
</h3>

<p>
His sword and helmet cases, his portmanteau and travelling
rugs were duly strapped and placed in the stately old
entrance-hall in readiness, as Roland was to be off by an
early morning train, and never again would he break bread
in the home of his forefathers.  Every link that bound him
to Earlshaugh was broken now, and he felt only a feverish
restlessness to be gone!
</p>

<p>
Ere that came to pass, Roland's eyes were fated to be
somewhat roughly opened.
</p>

<p>
All that day the nervous quivering of his nether lip, his
unusual paleness&mdash;notwithstanding his apparent calm&mdash;showed
to his sister that he was deeply agitated, and was
suffering from passionate, if suppressed, emotion.
</p>

<p>
In the deepening dusk of his last evening at Earlshaugh
he had, cigar in mouth, strolled forth alone to con over his
own bitter thoughts, and nurse his wrath 'to keep it warm,'
or inspired by a vague idea that he would sort his mind,
which was then in a somewhat chaotic condition.
</p>

<p>
The evening&mdash;one of the last in October&mdash;was cool, and
the wind wailed sadly in the task of stripping the trees of
their withered leaves, though at no time of the year do they
look so beautiful in the Scottish woods as in autumn, save,
perhaps, when they first burst forth in their emerald
greenery.
</p>

<p>
Round the tall old mansion, down the terraced walks,
past the lakelet and through the grounds he wandered till he
reached a kind of kiosk or summer-house, built of fantastic,
knotty branches, roofed with thatch, and furnished with a
rustic seat&mdash;a damp and gloomy place just then.  He threw
himself upon the latter, and, resting his head upon his hand,
proceeded to chew the cud of bitter fancy that had no
sweet in it.
</p>

<p>
The period had vanished when existence seemed full of
joyous dreams and a course of glowing scenes.  The world
was still as beautiful, no doubt, but it sparkled no more with
light and colour for him; idols had been shattered&mdash;ideals
had collapsed, and it seemed very cold and empty now.
</p>

<p>
How long he had been there he scarcely knew&mdash;perhaps
half an hour&mdash;when in the gloom under the half-stripped
trees he heard voices, and saw two figures, or made out a
male and female lingering near the summer-house, which he
dreaded lest they should enter, when he discovered them to
be Annot&mdash;Annot Drummond, muffled in a cosy white fur
cloak of Maude's&mdash;and, Heaven above!&mdash;of all men on
earth&mdash;Hawkey Sharpe!
</p>

<p>
For a moment or two Roland scarcely respired&mdash;his heart
seemed to stand still.  Intensely repugnant to him as it was
to act as eavesdropper on the one hand, on the other he was
proudly and profoundly reluctant to confront those two.
There he remained still, hoping every moment they would
move on and leave the pathway clear; but they remained,
and thus he heard more than he expected to hear from such
a singular pair.
</p>

<p>
He had now a clue to the reason of Annot's reluctance to
leave Earlshaugh, of her protracted visit as the guest of
Mrs. Lindsay, and why latterly she had so mysteriously and
sedulously cultivated the friendship of that lady.
</p>

<p>
The question, was it honourable to remain where he was,
flashed across Roland's mind!  It was not incompatible
with honour under the peculiar circumstances, so he heard
more.
</p>

<p>
'That nonsense has surely come to an end, or are you
still engaged to him?' said Hawkey, who held her hands
in his.
</p>

<p>
Annot was silent.  Could she be temporizing yet?
</p>

<p>
'Do you think he loves you as well as I do?' urged
Hawkey Sharpe, bending over her.
</p>

<p>
Still she was silent.
</p>

<p>
'If so, why has he ever left you, even for an hour, to shoot
and so forth, as he has often done?  Speak, Annot.  Surely
I may call you Annot now.'
</p>

<p>
Still there was no reply.  It seemed as if she was thinking
deeply&mdash;thinking how best to reply, to play her cards or to
temporize; but to what end, when all was over between her
and Roland now?
</p>

<p>
'You <i>were</i> engaged to him?' said Hawkey again, with a
little impatience of manner.
</p>

<p>
'By a chain of circumstances over which I had no control,'
replied Annot in a faltering voice; 'in his uncle's
house at Merlwood I was&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Was&mdash;is it ended?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;for ever.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank God for that!  Did you think you loved him?'
asked Hawkey with a grin.
</p>

<p>
'I believe that I did&mdash;or ought&mdash;I was so silly&mdash;so
simple&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'There&mdash;there&mdash;I don't want to worry you.'
</p>

<p>
'But he loves me, I know that,' said Annot in a low
voice&mdash;true to her vanity still.
</p>

<p>
'That I can well believe&mdash;who could see you and not love
you?' said Hawkey gallantly.
</p>

<p>
'I could never marry a poor man,' said Annot candidly.
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;he is poor enough.'
</p>

<p>
'And live on, eating my heart out in struggles such as
some I have seen,' continued Annot as if to herself.
</p>

<p>
'Though here in Earlshaugh just now, what is he, this
fellow Lindsay, but a penniless pretender!' exclaimed Sharpe,
fired with animosity against Roland; who thus heard his
name, his position, and the dearest secrets of his heart
openly canvassed by this presumptuous and low-born fellow,
and with Annot too&mdash;she who, till lately&mdash;but he could not
put his thoughts in words&mdash;they seemed to choke him; and
the whole situation was degrading&mdash;maddening!
</p>

<p>
'Well,' chuckled Sharpe, 'he is out of the running now;
and then you and I understand each other so well, my little
golden-haired pet! so true it is that "when a woman of the
world and a man of the world meet, whatever the circumstances
may be, or the surroundings, in a moment there is
rapport between them, and all flows along easily."  I thought
when Lindsay fell into the Cleugh,' he added, with a coarse
laugh, 'that he had betaken himself off to something that
suited him better than fighting the Arabs.  But it is long ere
the deil dies&mdash;now he is well and whole again, and looks
every inch like the Lindsay in the gallery, with the buff coat
and a dish-cover on his head, that led a brigade of horse
against the English at Dunbar.  Well, the old place has
done with that brood now; and after Deb, Earlshaugh
must be mine&mdash;mine&mdash;shall be <i>ours</i>, Annot, for ever and
aye!'
</p>

<p>
The breeze caught the lace of her sleeve, and, lifting it,
showed the perfect and lovely contour of her soft white arm,
on which Hawkey Sharpe fastened his coarse lips with a
fervour there could be no doubting.
</p>

<p>
Kissed by him?  Roland felt perfectly cured.  The
desecration, the dishonour, seemed complete!  It is but
too probable that Mr. Hawkey Sharpe felt the exultation
of revenge and triumph in every kiss he took, even though
he believed them to be unseen.
</p>

<p>
Though it was now apparent that she had thrown 'dust'
in Roland's eyes by using the name of <i>another</i>, and had thus
doubly lied to him, the blow did not fall so unexpectedly,
yet the degradation of it was complete.
</p>

<p>
Hoyle was a myth&mdash;a blind to throw him off the right
track&mdash;and he had been discarded, not for that personage,
but for Hawkey Sharpe.  This was truly to find
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'In the lowest deep a lower deep'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
of utter humiliation!
</p>

<p>
At last they passed onward, and he was again alone.
</p>

<p>
'I have undergone something like the torture of the
rack,' said he with a bitter laugh, when he related to Maude
and Hester what he had been compelled to overhear in the
summer-house, and the latter thought of that eventful evening
at Merlwood, when she so unwittingly had in like manner
been compelled to lurk in the shrubbery and hear a
revelation that crushed her own heart to the dust.
</p>

<p>
Thus, though he knew it not, the tables were turned on
Roland with a vengeance.
</p>

<p>
Like Hester, he could not agree with Romeo&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'How sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
when the said tongues addressed all their sweetness to
others.
</p>

<p>
'She is an ungrateful, selfish, horrible girl&mdash;I'll never
forgive her&mdash;never!' said Maude, almost sobbing with
anger.
</p>

<p>
'How filthy lucre rules the world now!' exclaimed Roland.
'Do such girls as she ever repent the mischief they make&mdash;the
hearts they have broken?'
</p>

<p>
'As if hearts break nowadays? she would ask,' said Hester
with something of a smile.
</p>

<p>
'Likely enough&mdash;it is her style, no doubt.  But can you,
Hester, or anyone, explain this cruel duplicity?  To me it
seems as if I were still in the middle of a horrid dream&mdash;a
dream from which I must suddenly wake.  That she, so
winsome and artless apparently&mdash;so gentle and loving,
should become so cold, so calculating, so mercilessly cruel
now!'
</p>

<p>
'I always mistrusted her,' said Maude bitterly.  'People
call her eyes hazel&mdash;to me they always seemed a kind of
vampire-green.'
</p>

<p>
Roland made no reply, but he was thinking with Whyte-Melville:
</p>

<p>
'Who shall account for the fascination exercised by some
women upon all who approach their sphere?  The peculiar
power of the rattlesnake, whose eye is said to lure the
conscious victim unresistingly to its doom, and the attractive
properties possessed by certain bodies, and by them used
with equal recklessness and cruelty, are two arrangements of
Nature which make me believe in mesmerism.'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;to-morrow I quit this place without beat of drum!'
exclaimed Roland.
</p>

<p>
'For Edinburgh?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;to the Club.'
</p>

<p>
'And then?'
</p>

<p>
'For Egypt.  There I shall live every day of my life as if
there were no to-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
'Nonsense!' said Jack.  'You'll get over all this in
time&mdash;a hit in the wing, that is all!'
</p>

<p>
Old Johnnie Buckle, who had forebodings in the matter
of Roland's departure, had tears in his eyes as he drove him
in the drag to the railway station next morning, and as he
wrung his hand at parting he said&mdash;showing that he knew
precisely of the double trouble that had fallen on the young
Laird:
</p>

<p>
'Better twa skaiths than ae sorrow, Maister Roland,'
meaning that losses can be repaired, but grief may break
the heart; 'and mind ye, sir,' he added, as the train started,
'a' the keys o' the country dinna hang at ae man's belt, and
ye'll wear your ain bannet yet!'
</p>

<p>
And on this <i>bouleversement</i> we need scarcely refer to the
emotions of those who loved Roland best.
</p>

<p>
Jack Elliot, as he selected a cigar to smoke and think the
situation over, deemed that Roland was well out of the
whole affair; Maude, who was preparing for her departure
from Earlshaugh, like Hester, was furiously indignant; but,
for reasons of her own, the thoughts of the latter were of a
somewhat mingled nature.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XL.
<br /><br />
THE NEW POSITION.
</h3>

<p>
Though, by her own admission, not entirely ignorant of
Annot's secret springs of action, that social buccaneer,
Mr. Hawkey Sharpe, was exultantly defiant about his victory
over, and revenge on, Roland Lindsay, for such he deemed
the new position to be; and in his pale gray eyes, as he
thought over it, there gleamed a savage light, such as it is
said 'men carry when the thirst for blood possesses them.'
</p>

<p>
Roland, whom latterly Mrs. Lindsay had learned to like
better than was her wont, was now gone, and would nevermore,
she was assured, repass the door of Earlshaugh, and
she actually felt as much regret for him as it was in her hard,
cold nature to feel.  He had been kind, her heart said to
herself, and his soft, gentle, and polished manners contrasted
most favourably with those of the few men she met now,
and especially with those of her brother Hawkey.
</p>

<p>
'The self-contained bearing, the habitual repose of one
who mixes in good society, invariably displays,' it is said,
'a striking dissimilarity to those who, immersed in the
business of life, have not such opportunities.  Women note
these things keenly; especially do they regard the carriage
of those whom they believe to move in circles above their
own.'
</p>

<p>
With regard to Annot, as one connected by marriage with
the Lindsay family, she was not sorry at the turn affairs had
taken with regard to that enterprising young lady and her
brother, Hawkey Sharpe.  Socially, Annot was far beyond,
or above, the bride he could ever have hoped to win, and
she might be the means of raising him, steadying and curing
him of his horsy, low, and gambling propensities, which had
made him prove a great anxiety in many ways, with all his
usefulness to herself, since, on her husband's death, she
became mistress of Earlshaugh.
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, Deb, old girl,' said he, as he pocketed a cheque
of hers for fifty pounds, and thought gloomily over the two
thousand that would in time become inexorably due and
must be paid, or see him stigmatized as a <i>welsher</i>!
</p>

<p>
'Little does the outer world know of all I have to put up
with from you, Hawkey,' said she, with a sigh, as she
locked away her cheque-book, and he surveyed her with a
cool and discriminating stare through his eyeglass&mdash;the use
of which be affected in imitation of others&mdash;screwed into his
right eye.
</p>

<p>
'It is too bad of you to talk to me in that way, Deb,'
said he, 'when I have cut out and relieved you of the
presence of that impudent beggar, Lindsay.  Miss Drummond,
as an only daughter, must, I suppose, be the heiress
to something or other.'
</p>

<p>
'I thought she would never look with favour on you&mdash;but
treat you as Maude did,' said Mrs. Lindsay, slowly
fanning herself with a large black lace fan.
</p>

<p>
Hawkey laughed maliciously; then he suddenly set his
teeth together and exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
'Maude!  I'll pay <i>her</i> out yet&mdash;she and I have not
squared our accounts&mdash;I shall be even with her before long.
As for little Annot not looking at me&mdash;by Jove, she has
looked and said all I could have wished.  She is not so
"stand-off" and unapproachable as you may think all her
set to be, when a fellow knows the way to go about it&mdash;as I
rather flatter myself I do,' he added, caressing his
straw-coloured and tenderly-fostered moustache, and pulling up
his shirt-collar.
</p>

<p>
'But where have you and she met, since you ceased to
occupy your rooms here?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh&mdash;with the hounds&mdash;in the park&mdash;wherever I wished,
in fact.  You and she, Deb, will get on excellently together,
if we all play our cards well now&mdash;I marry one of the
family, don't you see?  Then, I haven't a doubt that Annot
has money.'
</p>

<p>
'Did she give you reason to suppose she has?'
</p>

<p>
'N&mdash;no&mdash;not exactly&mdash;well?'
</p>

<p>
'She will succeed to whatever her mother may
have&mdash;little, probably.'
</p>

<p>
'Will have, or <i>may</i> have&mdash;shady that!  Well, unlike
most heiresses, she's a deuced pretty little girl, Deb, and
suits my book exactly.  So, with your assistance, we shall
be all right.'
</p>

<p>
'My assistance?'
</p>

<p>
'Of course.'
</p>

<p>
'Bright, soft, and girlish as she seems, I suspect there is
not a more artful damsel in London,' said Mrs. Lindsay
shrewdly.
</p>

<p>
'Oh bosh, Deb!  Well, if it be so, two can do the artful
game; but does not your own knowledge of human nature
lead you to see,' he added sententiously, 'that art and
prudence too give place when love comes on the scene?'
</p>

<p>
'Love&mdash;yes&mdash;are you quoting a play?  Will this fancy of
hers last&mdash;if fancy it is?'
</p>

<p>
'Why not?'
</p>

<p>
'You are not a gentleman in her sense of the word.'
</p>

<p>
'You are deuced unpleasant, Deb!' said he, contemplating
his spiky nails.
</p>

<p>
'And her sudden quarrel with Roland Lindsay&mdash;if
quarrel it was&mdash;I do not understand.'
</p>

<p>
'I do.  He is a poor beggar&mdash;dropped out of the
hunt&mdash;and I&mdash;I am&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What?'
</p>

<p>
'Supposed to be your heir,' said he, putting the
suggestion gently; 'long, long may it be only
supposition, Deb; but a few thousands yearly&mdash;say
five&mdash;would make us all right, and then we have the run
of the house here&mdash;what more do we want?  So all will be
right, even with the county, I say again, if we only play
our cards well.'
</p>

<p>
She had played <i>her</i> cards well in the past time, she
thought, as Hawkey, whom conversation always made
thirsty, left her in quest of a brandy and soda.
</p>

<p>
Seated in her luxurious boudoir, her memory went back
to the days of her early life, as an underpaid and
hard-worked governess; and then to those when she became the
humble and useful companion to Roland's mother, and,
after her death, a kind of guardian to Maude on the latter
leaving school.  Then came the accident that befel the old
Laird in the hunting-field at Macbeth's Stank&mdash;a wet ditch
with a 'yarner' on each side, the terror of the Fife Hunt,
but said to have been leapt by the usurper's horse when he
returned from Dunnimarle after slaying the family of
Macduff; and how necessary she made herself to the
suffering invalid; how (artfully) she seemed to anticipate
his thoughts, to understand all his wants, his favourite
dishes and so forth; and how grateful he became to her,
and how she clung to him like a barnacle or octopus,
without seeming to do so.  How necessary he soon found
it to have a clever, sensible, and loving woman&mdash;one rather
handsome, too&mdash;to look after him, when his two sons&mdash;especially
that spendthrift in the Scots Guards&mdash;seemed to
regard him as only a factor or banker to draw upon without
mercy; and so he married her one morning when the
weather was very cold; when the early snow was on the
Ochil summits and powdering the Lomonds of Fife, and
<i>then</i> she knew that she was the wife of a landed gentleman
of old and high descent&mdash;Colin Lindsay, Laird of Earlshaugh!
</p>

<p>
She was, of course, to be a second mother to Maude (who
declined to view her as such) and to his two sons if they
became careful; and meantime, ere dying, he handed over
to her, by will, as stated, beyond all hope of disputing it at
law, every wood, acre, and tree he possessed, causing much
uplifting of hands and shaking of heads in ominous wonder
throughout the county, and more especially in the East
Neuk thereof.
</p>

<p>
But she bore herself well, dressed richly as became her
age and new station&mdash;kept a handsome carriage with her
late husband's arms&mdash;the fesse chequy argent and azure for
Lindsay&mdash;thereon in a lozenge; but was rarely seen in the
company of Maude, who did not, would not, and never
could, approve of the position so ungenerously assigned to
herself and her only surviving brother Roland, who had
been much less to blame than his senior of the Household
Brigade.
</p>

<p>
And Mrs. Lindsay was just then beginning to discover
that she was likely to have&mdash;in the person of her brother, as
an intrusive, if sometimes necessary factotum&mdash;something
of a skeleton in her cupboard at Earlshaugh.
</p>

<p>
Since the Laird's death, Hawkey Sharpe had loved well
to pose as a man of influence and importance&mdash;more than
all, as the probable and future proprietor of Earlshaugh;
and liked to imagine how all would look up to him then
and seek his favourable notice.
</p>

<p>
His sister's secret and deadly ailment was to him a
constant source of anxiety that was <i>not</i> borne of affection;
he dreaded, also, her 'kirk proclivities,' and the influence
possessed over her 'by that old caterpillar, the minister.'
'I'll have to look sharp now after my own interests&mdash;old
Deb is getting rather long in the tooth for me,' he would
think at times.
</p>

<p>
Treated as she had been by Maude and others of the
family since her marriage, she could not have a very kindly
feeling to the Lindsay line.  'Blood is warmer than water,'
says our Scottish proverb; and Hawkey was the only
kinsman she had in the world that she knew of; but, a
scapegrace, a spendthrift, and toady to herself, as she knew
him to be, some of her sympathies were just then rather
more with the disinherited Roland Lindsay than Mr. Hawkey
Sharpe would have relished, had he in the least
suspected such a thing.
</p>

<p>
And Annot's thoughts on reviewing her new position were
rather of a mingled sort, and something of this kind:
</p>

<p>
'I am going to marry this man Hawkey Sharpe.  Odious
man!  I cannot pretend, even to myself, to be much in love
with him&mdash;if at all; yet I am going to marry him&mdash;and
why?  Because I love the splendid patrimony that, in time,
will become his; this beautiful estate, this grand old house,
the parure of family diamonds, and the settlements that
must be made upon me.  I always meant to marry the first
wealthy man who asked me, and now I am only true to my
creed&mdash;the creed mamma taught me.  Can anyone blame
me for that?  Of course I would rather a thousand times
have had poor Roland with Earlshaugh, because he is a man
that any woman might love and be proud of; but failing him,
I must put up with the person and name of&mdash;Hawkey
Sharpe.  Can anyone think it very wicked that I&mdash;a
penniless little creature&mdash;should prefer such a well-feathered
nest as this to that gloomy and small poky house in South
Belgravia, with its one drab of a servant, cold meat, shabby
clothes, and all its sordid concomitants?  No; give me the
ease, the prosperity, the luxury, and the flesh-pots of
Earlshaugh, with its manor and lands, wood, hill, and field.'
</p>

<p>
But it was a considerable relief to her mind&mdash;shamelessly
selfish though she was&mdash;when within twenty-four hours after
Roland's departure her two cousins and Jack Elliot (whose
faces she cared never to see again) also left for the capital,
and she remained behind the guest of&mdash;Mrs. Lindsay.
</p>

<p>
'As for Roland,' Annot thought, '<i>he</i> will get over our
little affair easily.  He loved me, no doubt, but love we
know to be only a parenthesis in the lives of most men.'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLI.
<br /><br />
THE CAPTIVE.
</h3>

<p>
We must now change the scene to the Soudan&mdash;<i>Beled-es-Soudan</i>,
or 'The Land of the Blacks,' so called by ancient
geographers&mdash;whither a single flight of imagination will take
us without undergoing a fortnight's voyage by sea to Alexandria,
<i>viâ</i> the Bay of Biscay, with its long, heavy swells, and
the Mediterranean, which is not always like a mill pond;
and then a long and toilsome route across the Lower and
Upper Provinces to where the Sheikh Moussa Abu Hagil
was journeying towards his remote home, with the luckless
Malcolm Skene in his train&mdash;a place on the borders of the
Nubian Desert, not far from the Nile, in the neighbourhood
of the third cataract, and situated about midway between
Assouan, the name of which had not, as yet, become a
'household word' with us, and Khartoum, where then the
well-nigh despairing Gordon was still waging his desperate
defence against the Mahdi.
</p>

<p>
By this time how weary had the eye&mdash;yea, the very soul&mdash;of
the luckless captive become of the desert scenery, in a
land visited only by a few bold travellers, who in times past
had accompanied the caravans from one valley to another.
There the desert sand is deep and loose, with sharp flinty
stones, in some places sprinkled with glistening rock salt,
and showing here and there a grove of dwindled acacias or
tufts of colocynth and senna, to relieve the awful dreariness
of its aspect.
</p>

<p>
The water in the pools, even in the rainy season, is there
black and putrid; hence the Arabs of the district remove
with their flocks to better regions, where the higher
mountains run from Assouan to Haimaur.
</p>

<p>
Steering, as it were, unerringly by landmarks known to
themselves alone, the Sheikh Moussa Abu Hazil and his
followers made progress towards his home&mdash;or zereba&mdash;in
the quarter we have mentioned.
</p>

<p>
Malcolm Skene had now been conveyed so far inland by
his captors that escape seemed hopeless; yet, buoyed up by
the secret chance that such <i>might</i> come, he struggled on
with the party day by day, ignorant of the fate that awaited
him, though he could never forget that of Palmer and his
companions on the shore of the Red Sea.
</p>

<p>
More than once Hassan Abdullah mockingly held before
him the pocket compass, which, of course, he had contrived
to abstract on some occasion.  Its loss did not matter much
now, but it was eventually appropriated by the Sheikh
Moussa, whether it were <i>efrit</i> or not; and Hassan, who
seemed inclined to resent this, received in reward a blow
from their leader's lance.
</p>

<p>
The latter, who, in some respects, was not unlike the
published portraits of his kinsman Zebehr, was at the head of a
body of Bedouins, not Soudanese.  Each tribe of these wild
horsemen is considered to have an exclusive property in a
district proportioned to the strength and importance of the
tribes, but affording room for migration, which is
indispensable among a people whose subsistence is derived from
cattle, and the spontaneous produce of the sterile regions
they inhabit.  Thus they often join neighbouring tribes,
Emirs and Sheikhs, in the hope of an advantageous change.
In this manner were this Bedouin troop under the banner of
Sheikh Moussa.
</p>

<p>
All were thin and hardy men, with the muscles of their
limbs more strongly developed than the rest of the body;
their strength and activity were great, and their power of
abstinence such that, like their own camels, they could
travel four or five days without tasting water.  Their deep
black eyes glared with an intensity never seen in Northern
regions, and gave full credence to the marvellous stories
Skene had heard of their extraordinary powers of discriminating
vision and the acuteness of their other senses.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the nearly nude warriors of the Mahdi, these
Bedouins under their floating burnous wore shirts of coarse
cotton with wide and loose sleeves&mdash;a garment rarely
changed or washed.  Over this some had a Turkish gown
of mingled cotton and silk, but most of them wore a mantle,
called an <i>abba</i>, like a square, loose sack, with slits for the
arms, woven of woollen thread and camel's hair, girt by a
girdle, and showing broad stripes of many colours; but
trousers of all kinds seemed superfluities unknown.
Picturesque looking fellows they were, and reminded Skene of
the descriptive lines in Grant's 'Arabia':
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Freedom's fierce unconquered child,<br />
  The Bedouin robber, nursling of the wild,<br />
  With whirlwind speed he guides his vagrant band,<br />
  Fire-eyed and tawny as their subject sand:<br />
  On foam-flecked steeds, impetuous all advance,<br />
  Whirl the bright sabre, couch the quivering lance,<br />
  Or grasping, ruthless, in the savage chase,<br />
  The belt-slung carbine and spike-headed mace,<br />
  Ardent for plunder, emulate the wind,<br />
  Scorn the low level, spurn the world behind;<br />
  While the dense dust-cloud rears its giant form,<br />
  And, rolled in spires, revealed the threatening storm.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Malcolm Skene found that he was rather a favourite with
these wild fellows from the facility with which he could
converse with them in Arabic; and though he knew not the
<i>thousand</i> names that language is said to possess for a sword,
he could repeat to them the <i>Fatihat</i>, or short opening
chapter of the Koran, called that of prayer and
thanksgiving; and they accorded him great praise accordingly.
And, sooth to say, any Christian may repeat it without evil,
as it simply runs thus in English:
</p>

<p>
'Praise be to God, the Lord of all creatures; the Most
Merciful; the King of the Day of Judgment!  Thee do we
worship, and of Thee do we beg assistance.  Direct us in
the right way of those to whom Thou hast been gracious;
not of those against whom Thou art incensed, nor of those
who go astray.'
</p>

<p>
But he knew the hostility of the slimy and savage Greek,
Pietro Girolamo, and of the cowardly and false Egyptian,
Hassan Abdullah, was undying towards him, and that they
only waited for the opportunity to take his life, if possible
unknown to the Sheikh, and then achieve their own escape
from the latter.
</p>

<p>
On every occasion that suited they reviled him, spat on
him, and hurled pebbles at him; but if their hands wandered
instinctively to pistol or poniard he had but to utter
the magic words to the Sheikh Moussa, 'Ana dakheilak!'
(I am your protected), and the lowering of the lance-head in
threat sufficed to send them cowed to the rear.
</p>

<p>
Moussa now made Skene acquainted with a fact which,
though explanatory as to the reason why his life was spared,
did not prove very soothing or hopeful; that he meant to
retain him at his zereba as a hostage for his kinsman Zebehr
Pasha, 'then under detention at Cairo by those sons of dogs
the English&mdash;<i>Allah bou rou Gehenna</i>!'
</p>

<p>
Hence, as yet, Malcolm knew that his life was deemed of
some value to his captors, who did not then foresee the
future deportation of the king of the slave dealers, by Lord
Wolseley's orders, to Gibraltar.
</p>

<p>
To escape, on foot or horseback, or in any way elude the
Bedouin guard, seemed to him a greater difficulty than to
achieve the same thing from Soudanese, so well were the
former mounted, so amply armed, so fleet and active in
movement, and every way so acute, eagle-eyed, serpent-like
in wile and wisdom and relentless as a tiger in fury and
bloodshed.
</p>

<p>
Even if he could successfully elude them, what lay before
him&mdash;what behind, the way he must pursue, if ever again he
was to reach the world he had been reft from!  The
desert&mdash;the awful, trackless desert he had traversed in their
obnoxious company, but could never hope to traverse it
alone&mdash;the desert, where water is more precious to the
traveller than would be the famous Emerald Mountain of
Nubia itself!  It barred him out from civilization as
completely as if it had been the waves of a shoreless sea.
</p>

<p>
The Sheikh often rode by his side, and asked him many
perplexing questions about Europe and the land of the
French, of which the inquirer had not the most vague idea,
or of how the red soldiers Of the mysterious Queen reached
Egypt, or where they came from; of Stamboul, which he
thought was in Arabia; of India, which he thought was in
Russia&mdash;of who were the English, and who the British that
always aided them; adding, as he stroked his great beard,
that 'it mattered little, as they must all perish&mdash;<i>Feh sebil
Allah</i>!' (for the cause of God).
</p>

<p>
He hated them with a bitterness beyond all language, as
interferers with the traffic in <i>djellabs</i>, as the slave-dealers
term their human wares; and for the losses he had
sustained at their hands, like Osman Digna, when some of his
dhows were captured on their voyage to Jeddah by British
cruisers; and ultimately even Suakim became so closely
watched by the latter that his caravan leaders had to deposit
their captives by twos and threes at lonely places on the
shore of the Red Sea, to transmit them across it when
occasion served.  Then when he came to speak of the
Anglo-Egyptian slave convention, which was the ruin of the traders
in human flesh, he gnashed his teeth, his black eye-balls
shot fire, and he looked as if with difficulty he restrained
himself from pinning Skene to the sand with his lance.
</p>

<p>
It was the ruin of the Soudan, he declared, as the
Christians only wished to liberate all slaves that they might
become their property.  He had struggled against this, he
said, with voice and sword till the summer of 1881, when
the Mahdi, Mahommed Achmet Shemseddin, issuing from
his cave on the White Nile, proclaimed himself the New
Prophet.  Then he cast his lot with the latter, and in two
years after served with him at the capture of El Obeid, and
the slaughter of the armies of Hicks and Baker, when they
won together a holy influence and a military reputation,
which were greatly enhanced by subsequent conflicts and
events.
</p>

<p>
Such was the stern, unpleasant, and uncompromising
individual in whose hands Malcolm Skene found himself
retained as a hostage, in a trifling way it seemed, for
Zebehr-Rahama-Gymme-Abel, better known as Zebehr Pasha,
whilom the friend of General Gordon, but in reality the
most slippery, savage, and bitter enemy of Britain in the
present time.
</p>

<p>
And full of the heavy thoughts his entire circumstances
forced upon him, somewhere about the first of November
he found himself, with his escort, approaching a zereba
which had been one of the headquarters of Zebehr, but
latterly assigned to his kinsman, Sheikh Moussa, and the
very aspect of it made even the stout heart of Malcolm
Skene sink within him, as he had been prepared for a tented
camp, or wigwam-like village, but not for the place in which
he found himself, and which was one of those described by
Dr. Schweinfurth, the great German traveller, when he visited
Zebehr Pasha a short time before.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLII.
<br /><br />
THE ZEREBA OF SHEIKH MOUSSA.
</h3>

<p>
At some little distance from the Nile, but what distance,
whether one or ten <i>shoni</i>, Skene could not then discover,
stood the zereba to which the Sheikh had lately fallen
possessor after Zebehr (who had been lord of thirty exactly
similar), in a strip of green, where a few palms, lupins, and
beans grew in an amphitheatre of small mountains&mdash;rocky,
jagged, volcanic in outline and aspect.  A few camels and
donkeys grazed spectral-like in the vicinity amid a silence
that was intense, and in a district where there were no
flights of birds as in Egypt, and no wide reaches of valley
covered with green and golden plenty.
</p>

<p>
Through a gorge in the steep rocky mountains, whose sides
were blackened by the sun of unknown ages, and broken
into fragments by some great convulsion of nature, the zereba
was entered.
</p>

<p>
It was a group of well-sized huts, enclosed by tall hedges,
in the centre of which stood the private residence of Sheikh
Moussa, having various apartments, wherein usually armed
sentinels, black or swarthy, half-nude, with glowing eyes and
bright weapons&mdash;swords and spears or Remington rifles&mdash;kept
guard day and night.
</p>

<p>
Through these, as one who was to be treated, as yet, with
hospitality at least, Malcolm Skene was conducted by a
couple of handsomely attired slaves (for here the power of
the Anglo-Egyptian Convention was <i>nil</i>), who gave him
coffee, sherbet, and a tchibouk, all most welcome after the
last day's toilsome march; and, throwing himself upon a
carpet and some soft skins, he strove to collect his thoughts,
to calculate the distance and the perils that lay between him
and freedom, and to think what was to be done now!
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Bedouins were grooming their horses outside,
laughing, chatting, smoking, and drinking long draughts
of <i>bouza</i> from stone jars&mdash;a kind of Nubian beer made from
dhurra.
</p>

<p>
'People always meet again,' said Pietro Girolamo with a
savage grin, showing all his sharp, white teeth beneath a
long and coal-black moustache.  'The world is round, you
know, Signor, though the Sheikh thinks it flat&mdash;flat as my
roulette-table at Cairo.  Ah, Christi! we have not forgotten
that; sooner or later people always meet again, and so shall
we.'
</p>

<p>
And with these words, which contained a menace, the
Greek withdrew to some other part of the zereba, where he
seemed to be somewhat at home, as he was&mdash;Skene afterwards
discovered&mdash;father of the third and favourite wife of
Sheikh Moussa.
</p>

<p>
The chambers, or halls&mdash;for such they were&mdash;seemed
silent&mdash;save a strange growling and the rasping of iron
fetters&mdash;and empty now, though there sometimes, in the
palmy days of the slave trade, as many as two thousand
dealers in <i>djellabs</i> gathered with their chained and wretched
victims every year.
</p>

<p>
'The regal aspect of these halls of State,' says
Dr. Schweinfurth, 'was increased by the introduction of some
lions, secured, as may be supposed, by sufficiently strong
and massive chains.'
</p>

<p>
It was the rattle of the latter and the growling of the lions
that Malcolm Skene heard with more bewilderment than
curiosity on the subject.
</p>

<p>
Here in his favourite abode, Zebehr, says the doctor,
was long 'a picturesque figure, tall, spare, excitable, with
lions guarding his outer chamber, and his court filled with
armed slaves&mdash;smart, dapper-looking fellows, supple as
antelopes, fierce, unsparing, and the terror of Central
Africa; while around him gathered in thousands infernal
raiders, whose razzias have depopulated vast territories.
Superstitious, too, was Zebehr, for in his campaign against
Darfour, he melted down two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars into bullets&mdash;for no charm can stay a silver bullet&mdash;and
cruel as death itself!  A word from him here raised the
Soudan in revolt against Gordon in 1878; and it was only
after some fierce righting that Gessi Pasha succeeded in
breaking the back of the revolt.  After hunting the slave
raiders like wild beasts, he captured and shot eleven of
their chiefs, including Suleiman, the son of Zebehr.  Hence
the blood-feud between Gordon and Zebehr which led the
latter to refuse to accompany the former to Khartoum.
The slave-dealers were slain in hundreds by natives whom
they had plundered.  Zebehr's letters were found, proving
that he had ordered the revolt; but no action was taken
against him, and he continued to live in luxurious detention
at Cairo.'
</p>

<p>
When Baker Pasha was organizing his forces to relieve
Tokar, he asked that Zebehr might go with him at the head
of a Nubian division.  Zebehr and Sheikh Moussa Abu
Hagil raised the blacks, but the Anti-Slavery Society
protested against the employment of the former as improper
and in the highest degree perilous.  Sir Evelyn Baring
pleaded for Zebehr and Moussa, but Lord Granville was
inexorable.  He wrote: 'The employment of Zebehr Pasha
appears to her Majesty's Government inexpedient both
politically and as regards the slave trade.'
</p>

<p>
Thus far some of the history of yesterday, which,
nevertheless, may be new to the reader.
</p>

<p>
On his first entering the zereba Skene had returned the
formal welcome or greeting of Sheikh Moussa&mdash;touching
his forehead, lips, and breast&mdash;a symbolic action signifying
that in thought, word, and heart he was his.
</p>

<p>
Pietro Girolamo, the Greek Islesman from Cerigo, was&mdash;we
have said&mdash;the father-in-law (at least one of them) to
Moussa Abu Hagil.
</p>

<p>
Malcolm Skene came to the knowledge of that connection
through a stray copy of the now pretty well-known Arabic
newspaper, the <i>Mubashir</i>, which he found in the zereba;
and the columns of which contained a memoir of that enterprising
Sheikh, and in retailing some startling incidents in
his life gave a little light on certain habits of the dwellers in
the desert.
</p>

<p>
Girolamo had been the skipper of one of his slave dhows,
or armed brigs, in the Red Sea, during the palmy times,
when as many as five thousand head of slaves were exposed
annually in the market place of Shendy&mdash;a traffic in which
Moussa, like his kinsmen, Zebehr Pasha, had grown enormously
rich; and, for a suitable sum, he bought a daughter
of Girolamo, a beautiful Greek girl.  She became his third
wife, and died in giving birth to a daughter, the inheritor of
her pale and picturesque beauty, though shaded somewhat
by the Arab mixture in her blood; but in her fourteenth
year&mdash;a ripe age in those regions of the sun&mdash;her charms
were said to surpass all that had seen before and had become
the exaggerated theme of story-tellers and song-makers, even
in the market places and the cafés of Damanhour and
Cairo.
</p>

<p>
The girl was named Isha (or Elizabeth) after her mother,
and educated in such accomplishments as were deemed
necessary to the wife of a powerful and wealthy Emir, for
such Moussa destined her to be, if not perhaps of his friend
and leader the Mahdi Achmet when the time came; but
the old brigand&mdash;for the slave dealer was little better in
spirit or habit when not absent fighting, plundering, and
raiding in search of <i>djellabs</i>&mdash;seemed never happy save when
in the society of this daughter, his only one, his other
children being sons, four of whom had fallen in battle
against Hicks on the field of Kashgate.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding all the care with which the women of the
East are secluded in the <i>Kah'ah</i>, or harem, Isha had a lover,
a young Bedouin warrior named Khasim Jelalodeen, who,
though he had no more hope of winning her to share his
humble black tent than of obtaining the moon, loved her
with all the wild passion of which his lawless Arab nature
was capable.
</p>

<p>
To have whispered of this passion to the Sheikh Moussa,
whom we have described as resembling a mummy of the
Pharaohs' time resuscitated, would have ensured the
destruction of Khasim, who had only his sword, his rifle, and a
horse with all its trappings.
</p>

<p>
Yet Isha was not ignorant of the love the Bedouin bore
her, as he had a sister named Emineh, who was a kind of
companion and attendant of the former, and went between
the lovers as carefully and subtly as any old <i>Khatbeh</i>, or
betrother in the Abdin quarter in Cairo in the present
hour&mdash;thus freely bouquets, symbolically arranged&mdash;the
simple and beautiful love-letters of Oriental life, were
exchanged between them through the kind agency of
Emineh.
</p>

<p>
Sheikh Moussa loved his brilliant little daughter, but he
loved money more; and when a caravan, under an old
business friend of his named Ebn al Ajuz (or 'the son of the
old woman,' obtained by his mother's prayers in the mosque
of Hassan at Cairo) passed <i>en route</i> from Darfour for the
capital and Assiout, laden with ivory, gum, and slaves&mdash;chiefly
women and girls, the dealer, having heard of the
beauty of Isha, applied to the Skeikh, and made him an
offer which, as both were in the trade, he found himself&mdash;filial
regard and affection apart&mdash;bound to consider.
</p>

<p>
Moussa, to do him justice, had no great inclination to sell
his daughter, the light of his household, though he had
remorselessly sold the daughters of others by the thousand;
yet he was curious to know her value, as prices had gone
down even before the arrival of Gordon at Khartoum,
especially when Ebn al Ajuz spoke of the sum he was
prepared to give, and that the purse-holder was no other than
that generally supposed misogynist, the Khedive himself.
</p>

<p>
He introduced the merchant to her apartments in order
to show her merits and discover the price, of which he could
judge, however, by his own business experience.
</p>

<p>
Her rooms, covered with soft carpets, having luxurious
divans, decorated ceilings, and tiled floors, with beautiful
brackets supporting finely wrought vessels, and having large
windows of lattice work, others of stained glass, representing
floral objects, bouquets, and peacocks, Arabic inscriptions
and maxims written in letters of gold and green, received no
attention from the turbaned and bearded slave-dealer, whose
attention was at once arrested by Isha, who had been clad,
she knew not why, in her richest apparel, with her eyebrows
needlessly blackened and her nails reddened by henna.
</p>

<p>
Ebn al Ajuz, whom long custom had rendered a dispassionate
judge of beauty in all its stages, from the fairest
Circassian with golden hair to the dark and full-lipped woman
of Nubia, was struck with astonishment by the many
attractions of the half-Greek girl.
</p>

<p>
'Allah Kerim!' he exclaimed.  'With her face, form, and
entire appearance I have not the slightest fault to find,' he
frankly acknowledged; 'every motion, every attitude, every
feature display the most beautiful grace, symmetry, and
proportion.  Allah! she should be named Ayesha, after the
perfect wife of the prophet!'
</p>

<p>
On hearing this a blush burned in the face of the girl, and
she pulled down her yashmac or veil.
</p>

<p>
The merchant pressed Moussa to name her price, as they
sat over their pipes and coffee; and so greatly did avarice
exceed affection, that Moussa, who&mdash;said the writer in the
<i>Mubashir</i>&mdash;it was thought would not have exchanged his
daughter for the Emerald Mountain itself, was so dazzled by
the offer made that he agreed to sell her, and preparations
even were at once made for her departure, despite her tears,
her entreaties, and her despair.
</p>

<p>
Khasim Jelalodeen was filled with grief and consternation.
Oh for Jinn or Efrits, the spirits born of fire, to aid him!
</p>

<p>
He had his fleet horse corned, refreshed by a bitter
draught of <i>bouza</i> (not water), saddled, and in constant
readiness for any emergency; and in the night, well armed,
with his heart on fire and his brain in a whirl, he made his
way secretly and softly to that part of the zereba in which
the <i>Kah'ah</i>, or women's apartments, were situated&mdash;an act
involving his death if caught, and caught he was by the
guards of Moussa, who were about to slay him on the spot;
but immemorial usage has established a custom in the Desert
that if a person who is in actual danger from another can in
anticipation claim his protection, or touch him barehanded,
his life is saved.
</p>

<p>
He passed himself as a <i>Karami</i>, or mere robber, and as
such was made a close prisoner, destined to await the
pleasure of Moussa, who had just then a good deal to
occupy his mind.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Emineh, having ascertained exactly where her
rash, bold brother was in durance, contrived to introduce
herself there next night with a ball of thread, and tying an
end thereof to his right wrist she withdrew, winding it
carefully off as she went, till she penetrated to the sleeping
apartment of Moussa, and applying the other end to his
bosom woke him, saying in Arab fashion:
</p>

<p>
'Look on me, by the love thou bearest to God and thy
own self, for <i>this</i> is under thy protection!'
</p>

<p>
Then the startled and angry Sheikh arose, took his sword,
and followed the clue till it guided him to where Khasim,
the supposed <i>Karami</i>, was confined, and he was compelled
to declare himself the protector of the latter.  His bonds
were taken off; the thongs with which his hair, in token of
degradation, had been tied were cut with a knife; he was
entertained as a newly-arrived guest, and was then set at
liberty.
</p>

<p>
Emineh gave him his horse and arms, and he took his
departure from the vicinity of the zereba, but only to watch
in the distance.
</p>

<p>
'In due time the caravan of Ebn al Ajuz came forth from
the gates and boundaries of thorny hedge, and the lynx-eyed
Arab, Khasim, with his heart beating high, watched it
from the concealment of a mimosa thicket, and knew the
curtained camel litter which contained the object of his
adoration, as the flinty-hearted Moussa was seen to ride
beside it for a time.
</p>

<p>
The love of Khasim was not that of the educated, the
cultivated, as it is understood in other parts of the world&mdash;the
cultivated in music, art, and literature&mdash;but of its kind
it was a pure, ardent, and passionate one, and in its fiery
nature unknown to 'the cold in clime and cold in blood.'
</p>

<p>
He would bear her away, he thought; she would yet be
his bride, won by his spear and horse, like the bride of
many an Arab song and story; they would have a home
among the fairy-like gardens of Kordofan and beyond the
mountains of Haraza.  Was he not invulnerable?  Had he
not an amulet bound to his sword-arm by the Mahdi
himself&mdash;an amulet before which even the bullets and bayonets
of the British had failed?
</p>

<p>
So the caravan with Isha wound on its way towards the
Desert!
</p>

<p>
How dark the red round sun had suddenly become.
Khasim looked up to see if it still shone, and it was setting
fast, amid clouds of crimson and gold, throwing long, long
purple shadows far across the plain, and there in its sheen
the Nile was running swiftly as ever&mdash;swift as life runs in
the Desert and elsewhere!
</p>

<p>
Out of the latter arose a cloud of dust, with many a
glittering point of steel!  The caravan was suddenly
attacked, its column broken and pierced by a band of wild
Kabbabish Arab horsemen, fifty in number at least, and led
by that slippery personage, the Mudir of Dongola, on whom
the British Government so grotesquely bestowed the Cross
of St. Michael and St. George&mdash;a gift ridiculed even by the
<i>Karakush</i>, or Egyptian <i>Punch</i>.
</p>

<p>
A conflict ensued; revolvers and Remington rifles were
freely used; saddles were emptied, and sabres flashed in
the moonlight.  General plunder of everything was the real
object of the Mudir and his Kabbabishes; to rescue Isha
was the sole object of Khasim, who charged in among
them.
</p>

<p>
Amid the wild hurly-burly of the conflict, the shrieks of
the women, their incessant cries of <i>walwalah!</i> the grunting
of the camels, the yells of the Arabs, and amid the dense
clouds of dust and sand raised by hoofs and feet, Khasim
Jelalodeen speedily found the litter in which the daughter
of Moussa was placed, and was in the act of drawing forth
her slight figure across his saddlebow&mdash;horror-stricken
though the girl was, albeit she had seen death in more than
one form before&mdash;when the merchant, Ebn al Ajuz,
exasperated to lose her after all the treasure he had spent,
shot her dead with his long brass pistol; but ere he could
draw another Khasim clove him to the chin, through every
fold of the turban, by one stroke of his long and trenchant
Arab sword, and, with a wild cry of grief and despair,
spurred his horse into the desert and was seen no more,
though rumour said he joined the banner of Osman Digna
before Suakim.
</p>

<p>
So this was a brief Arab romance of the nineteenth century
as acted out in a part of the world which changes not,
though all the world seems to change elsewhere.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Most wearily passed the time of Malcolm Skene's
captivity in the zereba of Moussa Abu Hagil.  Weeks became
months, and the closing days of the year found him still
there, and necessitated to be ever watchful, for both
Pietro Girolamo and Hassan Abdullah had, he knew,
sworn to kill him if an opportunity were given them; and
nothing had as yet stayed their hands but the influence
of the Sheikh, who protected him for purposes of his
own.
</p>

<p>
Thus his life was in hourly peril; the bondage he endured
was maddening, and he could not perceive any end to it
or escape from it save death.  As for escape, a successful
one seemed so hopeless, so difficult to achieve, that it
gradually became useless to brood over it&mdash;without arms, a
horse, money, or a guide.
</p>

<p>
He knew that he must now be deemed as one of the dead
by his regiment, by the authorities, and, more than all, by
his widowed mother and dearest friends, and have been
mourned by them as such.
</p>

<p>
Rumour had said ere he left Cairo that a relieving column
was to start for Khartoum.  How that might affect his fate
he knew not; it might be too late to help him in any way,
and to be <i>too late</i> was the order of our affairs in Egypt
now.
</p>

<p>
So time passed on, and he was in darkness as to all that
passed in the outer world.
</p>

<p>
At last there came tidings which made the Sheikh
Moussa eye him darkly, dubiously, and with undisguised
hostility&mdash;tidings which Malcolm Skene heard with no
small concern and alarm.
</p>

<p>
These were the close arrest of Zebehr Pacha as a traitor
to the Khedive Tewfik, and his sudden deportation from
Cairo beyond the sea to Gibraltar, by order of Lord
Wolseley.
</p>

<p>
This event, thought Skene, must seal his own fate as an
enforced and most unwilling hostage now!
</p>

<p>
The golden grain, the full-eared wheat and bearded
barley had been gathered in every field and on every
upland slope around his home; the year had deepened into
the last days of autumn; the woods and orchards of ancient
Dunnimarle were odorous of autumnal fruit and dying
leaves; the skies were gray by day and red and gloomy at
eve.
</p>

<p>
White winter had come, and every burn and linn been
frozen in its rocky bed; the thundering blasts that swept
the bosom of the Forth had rumbled down the wide
chimneys of Dunnimarle and swept leaves and even spray
against the window panes; while the aged trees in the glen
below had shrieked and moaned ominously in the icy
winds till winter passed away, and people began hopefully

mourned for her lost son&mdash;her handsome soldier son, ever

CHAPTER XLIII.
<br /><br />
A MARRIAGE.
</h3>

<p>
While Malcolm Skene was counting the days wearily and
anxiously, and, in common parlance, 'eating his heart out,'
in that distant zereba, near the Third Cataract of the Nile,
time and events did not stand still with some of his friends
elsewhere; among these certainly were Roland Lindsay and
Hester Maule, and the latter did indeed mourn for the hard
and unknown fate of one whose love she never sought but
surely won.
</p>

<p>
Roland did not start immediately for Egypt after turning
his back in mortification and disgust on Earlshaugh, but for
a brief time took up his quarters at the United Service Club
in Edinburgh with Jack Elliot.  The speedy marriage of
the latter and Maude, who had gone to Merlwood with
Hester, was then on the tapis, and fully occupied the
attention of all concerned.
</p>

<p>
It was impossible for anything like love to exist long,
after the rude shock&mdash;the terrible awakening&mdash;Roland had
received; yet ever and anon he found himself rehearsing
with intense bitterness of spirit the memory of scenes and
passages between himself and Annot&mdash;drivelling scenes he
deemed them now!  How had he said to her more than
once:
</p>

<p>
'My darling&mdash;my darling!  Be true to me; the day
when I cease to believe in you will kill me&mdash;you are such a
child&mdash;you know so little of the world, sweet one!'
</p>

<p>
'So little of the world&mdash;a child!' thought he.  'What an
ass I was!  I am not killed by it, and she has been false as
the devil.  How came I to say things that seemed so
prophetic?'
</p>

<p>
Thus, as he thought over all the love and blind adoration
he had lavished on her, he felt only rage and sickness at his
own folly.  He saw it all now, when it was too late&mdash;too
late!
</p>

<p>
What human heart has not learned the bitterness of these
two bitter words, in many ways, through life?
</p>

<p>
Yet, tantalizingly, she would come before him in dreams,
and thus recall him to the words of an old sonnet&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Half pleading and half petulant she stands;<br />
  Her golden hair falls rippling on my hands;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her words are whispered in their old sweet tone.<br />
  But neither word nor smile can move me now&mdash;<br />
  There is an unseen shadow on her brow.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot love, because all trust is gone!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was a very awkward subject for Hester to approach,
yet, seeing him so moody, so silent and trist, when first
again he came to Merlwood, she said to him timidly and
softly:
</p>

<p>
'Forget the past, Roland.  She made no real impression
on your heart, but affected your imagination only.'
</p>

<p>
And now he began to think that such was indeed the
case; while to Maude it seemed strange indeed that Annot
Drummond should be at Earlshaugh, posing as the future
mistress thereof, while she and her disinherited brother were
a species of outcasts therefrom.
</p>

<p>
Earlshaugh&mdash;the old house of so many family traditions
and memories&mdash;was very dear to Maude in spite of all the
dark and mortifying hours she had lately spent under its
roof.  What races and frolics and fun had gone on there in
the past time, when she, her brothers, and Hester Maule
were all happy children, in the long corridors and ghostly
old attics, under the steep roofs and pointed turrets where
the antique vanes creaked in the wind; and how greater
seemed their fun when the rain storms of winter or spring
came rattling down on the old stone slates, and they all
nestled together under the slope, with a sense of protection
and power unknown in future years&mdash;so the girl's heart clung
to the old roof-tree with a love that nothing in the future
could destroy.
</p>

<p>
There was no use thinking of all these and a thousand
other things, as her home was now to be wherever that of
Jack Elliot was.
</p>

<p>
Some of her regrets at times were shared by Roland, for
they were a race peculiar to&mdash;but not alone in&mdash;Scotland,
these Lindsays of Earlshaugh.
</p>

<p>
They had ever been high in pride and strong in self-will,
lording it over their neighbours in the Howe and East Neuk
of Fife, in the days when many a barbed horse was in stall,
and many an armed man, 'boden in effeir of weir,' sat at
the Laird's table; proud of their ancient pedigree and many
heroic deeds, all unstained by timidity in war, and foreign
gold in time of peace&mdash;a stain few Scottish noble families
are without; proud of the broad lands that had come to
them not by labour or talent certainly, but by the undoubted
right to be lords of the soil by inheritance, when the soil was
not held by a mere sheepskin, but by the sword and
knight-service to the Scottish Crown.
</p>

<p>
And now to return to more prosaic times.  We have said
that there was a chronic antagonism between Maude and
her stepmother, Mrs. Lindsay; then, when Roland hurried
to quit Earlshaugh, she and Jack resolved to get married,
and married they were, quite quietly, as Roland was in
haste to be gone to Egypt, and they were to pass a brief
honeymoon ere Jack followed him&mdash;as he had inexorably to
take his turn of service there too.
</p>

<p>
Of the Earlshaugh will, and Maude's small inheritance
under it, Jack made light indeed.
</p>

<p>
'What matters it?' said he; 'I am Elliot of Braidielee,
and there will be our home-coming, when we have smashed
up the Mahdi, and I can return with honour!'
</p>

<p>
At this marriage Annot Drummond was not present&mdash;no
invitation was given to her, and Mrs. Lindsay excused
herself through illness.  Maude laughed at her apology.
</p>

<p>
'Though we were grown up, and so beyond her reach in
some respects, she has been like the typical stepmother of
the old fairy tales,' said the girl, who, sunny-haired,
blue-eyed, and bright, looked wonderfully beautiful, apart from
t lat strange halo which surrounds every bride on her
marriage day.
</p>

<p>
'All weddings are dull affairs, and we are well out of this
one&mdash;don't you think so?' said Annot coyly to her new
lover.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps, but ours won't be so,' replied Hawkey Sharpe
with a knowing wink.  'I expect it will be rather good
fun.'
</p>

<p>
She shivered a little at his bad style.  The visits that are
usually paid and received, the letters that are usually written,
the choosing of much useless millinery, furniture, plate, and
equipages, and the being 'trotted out' for the inspection of
mutual friends were all avoided or evaded by the quiet mode
in which Jack Elliot and Maude were made one, and their
nuptials a fact accomplished; but there was no time for
'doing' Paris, Berlin, the Riviera, or Rome, as Jack was
bound for Egypt within a tantalizingly short period, so he
secured a charming little villa for his bride in the southern
and perhaps most pleasing quarter of the Modern Athens
till he could return&mdash;if he ever did return&mdash;from that land
of disease and death, where so many of our young and brave
have found their last home.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hawkey Sharpe at Earlshaugh laughed viciously when
he read the announcement of the marriage in the newspapers.
It was not a pleasant laugh, even Annot thought,
and boded ill to some one.
</p>

<p>
Maude seemed beyond his reach now, so far as he seemed
concerned; but there remained to him still hatred and
revenge, as we may have to show.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap44"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIV.
<br /><br />
THE TROOPSHIP.
</h3>

<p>
So while Jack and Maude were absent on their brief
honeymoon Roland bade adieu to Hester, his old uncle Sir
Harry, and to pleasant Merlwood ere turning his steps to
the East.
</p>

<p>
As he looked on the refined face of the girl, with her
long-lashed gentle eyes, for the last time, something of the old
tenderness that Annot had clouded, warped, or won away,
came into his heart again, and he longed to take her kindly
in his arms ere he went, but stifled the desire, and simply
held forth his hand when she proffered her pale and
half-averted cheek.  He dared not kiss away the quiver he saw
upon her lips.
</p>

<p>
'Good-bye, dear Hester,' said he.  'Have you not a
word or two that I may take with me&mdash;such as a dear sister
might give?'
</p>

<p>
But her still quivering lips were voiceless; the forced
smile on them was gone, and the soft light of her violet-blue
eyes was quenched as if by recent tears; sweet eyes they
were, dreamy and languid, their white lids fringed by lashes
long and dark.
</p>

<p>
Roland noted this with a heavy heart, and thought his
gentle cousin never looked so beautiful or attractive as then,
when her little hand, which trembled, was clasped for the
last time in his, and she withdrew to the end of the room.
</p>

<p>
'Good-bye, nephew,' said Sir Harry, propping himself on
a stout Indian cane.  'God keep you from harm, and may
every good attend you; but,' he added, his keen eyes
glistening angrily through the film that spread over them,
'does your conscience quite absolve you?'
</p>

<p>
'In what, uncle?'
</p>

<p>
'What?  Why, your conduct to my girl&mdash;your cousin
Hester,' said Sir Harry, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
'Uncle?'
</p>

<p>
'Did you make no effort when last at Merlwood here to
win her admiration, her regard, her love?  Did you not
simply play with her heart, and deem it perhaps flirting?&mdash;hateful
word!  In all her anguish&mdash;and I have seen it&mdash;she
has never had a word of reproach for you, whatever her
thoughts, poor child, may be; but please to think another
time, Roland, and not attempt your powers of fascination
and to act the lady-killer, lest you crush a heart that might
be a happy one.'
</p>

<p>
Roland felt himself grow pale as he listened wistfully,
half mournfully, to these merited but most unexpected
remarks from the abrupt old gentleman, to whom he was
sincerely attached.  Knowing their truth, an emotion of
shame, with much of reproach or compunction, gathered in
his heart, and he muttered something apologetic&mdash;that he
had no longer the position or prospects he once had&mdash;that
Earlshaugh was no longer his&mdash;and felt in some haste to be
gone, though he was shocked to see that the old man
appeared to be suddenly and sorely broken down in health.
The Jhansi bullet had worked its way out at last, but left a
wound that would neither heal nor close; and hence, perhaps,
the irrepressible irritability that led to these reproaches,
some part of which reached the ear of Hester, and covered
her with the deepest confusion, and made her welcome the
moment of Roland's final departure; and then she said:
</p>

<p>
'Oh, papa, how could you speak as you did?  Roland
made me no proposal, asked me for no regard, and I gave
him&mdash;no promise.  I have known him, you are aware, all
my life, and I do love him very dearly&mdash;but as a brother&mdash;nothing
more,' added poor Hester with a very unmistakable
sob in her slender throat.  'You do him injustice&mdash;he has
not wronged me; but you know well how others have
wronged him.'
</p>

<p>
But her father only resumed the amber mouthpiece of his.
hookah, and continued to smoke in uncomfortable silence.
</p>

<p>
So Roland was gone, and apparently out of her life more
than ever now.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding that he certainly had not treated her
well at Merlwood, Hester was for a time quietly inconsolable
for his departure, which he had taken in a mood of
mind rendered so stern and reckless by the episode of
Annot, that she pitied him.
</p>

<p>
He would, she knew, court danger and wounds; seek
perhaps every chance of being killed&mdash;dying far away from
friends and kindred&mdash;dying a soldier's death without
getting, perchance, even a grave in the hot sands of the
desert.
</p>

<p>
He would, she feared, rush on his fate; 'but men often
make their own fate; they are weak who are blindly guided
by circumstances,' she had read.  'It is given us to
distinguish right from wrong; and if men persist in wrong
when the right is before them, then be the consequences on
their own head.'
</p>

<p>
The necklet&mdash;the gift he had given her at Merlwood&mdash;was
clasped lovingly round her throat now, and its pendant
nestled in her breast.
</p>

<p>
'The future is vague!' thought Hester; 'but one thing
is sure, we shall never be as we have been&mdash;what we were
to each other at one time&mdash;he and I.  Shall we ever meet
again&mdash;who can say?  The sea is treacherous with its
storms and other perils&mdash;the war is too dreadful to think
of!  We may never, never see each other more, and the
last hour he passed here may have been the last we shall
have spent together in this world.'
</p>

<p>
If he survived everything and came back again, could she
be like the Agnes of 'David Copperfield'?  She feared not.
Therein she had read the story of a noble woman who
had secretly loved a man all her life&mdash;even as she had loved
Roland, and who yet showed no sign of sorrow when he
married another woman.  Agnes was David's counseller and
friend until he was nearing middle age, and it was only
when he asked her to be his wife that she made the simple
confession of her lifelong love.
</p>

<p>
She pondered over all these things as she wandered alone
by the wooded Esk, the placid murmur of whose flow as it
lapped among the pebbles was the only sound that broke
the silence of the rocky glen, while at the same hour Roland
was amid a very different scene&mdash;one of high excitement,
noise, and bustle, almost uproar.
</p>

<p>
Alongside a great jetty in Portsmouth Harbour H.M. troopships
<i>Bannockburn</i> and <i>Boyne</i> were taking troops and
stores on board for Alexandria, and on the poop of the
former, a floating castle of 6,300 tons, Roland stood amid a
group of officers, whose numbers were augmenting every
few minutes, and the interest and excitement were
increasing fast, as it was known that when the great
white-hulled trooper cleared out the Queen had sent special
orders that the ship was to keep well to the westward, that
she might meet her in her own yacht and pay farewell to
the troops on board, mustering about six hundred men of
various arms of the service, and a host of staff and other
officers, including some of Roland's regiment.
</p>

<p>
A handsome fellow the latter looked in his blue braided
patrol-jacket, and white tropical helmet, with his sword
clattering by his side.
</p>

<p>
'When shall I be again in mufti?' thought he with a
laugh (using that now familiar term that came back from
Egypt of old with the soldiers of Abercrombie), and hearty
greetings met him on every hand.
</p>

<p>
'Lindsay&mdash;it is!  I didn't know you were rejoining,'
exclaimed a brother officer, whose wounded arm was still in a
sling.  'I thought your leave was not up till March.'
</p>

<p>
'I have resigned more than two months of it, Wilton,'
replied Roland.
</p>

<p>
'What an enthusiast, by Jove!'
</p>

<p>
'Not more than yourself, whose wound must be green yet.'
</p>

<p>
'Welcome&mdash;Roland,' cried another, a cheery young sub. with
a hairless chin like an apple; 'you are just the man we
want for the work before us.'
</p>

<p>
'That is right&mdash;jolly to see you again!' said a third.
</p>

<p>
'We missed you awfully, old fellow!' exclaimed a fourth.
</p>

<p>
Flattering were the greetings on every side as he stood
amid the circle of Hussars, Lancers, Artillery, and others,
neither perhaps the handsomest nor the tallest amid that
merry and handsome group, but looking a soldier every
inch in his somewhat frayed and faded fighting kit, which
had seen service enough a short time before.
</p>

<p>
'Here comes Mostyn of ours,' said Wilton, as a very
devil-may-care-looking young fellow, in the new khakee
uniform, with a field-glass slung over his shoulder, came
up.  'How goes it, Dick?&mdash;heard you had committed
matrimony.'
</p>

<p>
'Not such a fool, Wilton.'
</p>

<p>
'We heard you were rather gone with that elderly party
at Dover&mdash;the lass with all the rupees,' he added in a
would-be <i>sotto voce</i>.
</p>

<p>
'On the War Office principle that an old girl makes a
young widow?  No, Wilton, my boy,' said Mostyn as he
lit a cigarette, 'I leave these little lollies for such as you.
Her rupees were all moonshine, and her <i>poudre de riz</i>
was a little too plain; but I shouldn't like to have a
wife who pays her milliner's bills out of her winnings at
Ascot.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, Lindsay,' said an officer of another corps who had
just marched his little detachment on board, and gave
Roland, familiarly, a slap on the shoulder, 'how are
you&mdash;going out again to the land of the Pyramids?  Just keep
your eye on my fellows for a minute, will you, while I get
some tiffin below&mdash;hungry as a hawk&mdash;tore through London
to reach the Anglesea Barracks to-day; had only time to
get a glass of sherry and a caviare sandwich at the Rag,
then to get goggles and gloves, etc., in Regent
Street&mdash;ta-ta&mdash;will be on deck in a minute.'
</p>

<p>
The old familiar rattling society was delightful again,
even with its rather exaggerated gaiety and banter, and all
about him were so heedless, so happy, and full of the
highest spirits, that it was impossible not to feel the
contagion.
</p>

<p>
The bustle, though orderly, was incredible, and the
shipment of stores of all kinds seemed endless, including
ammunition, carts and waggons, draught and battery horses,
with thousands upon thousands of rounds of Martini-Henry
ball-cartridges, and innumerable rounds of filled
shells for thirteen and sixteen-pounder guns.
</p>

<p>
As senior officer of the mixed command going out,
Roland certainly found that he had work cut out for him
just then, and no time for farther regretting or thinking of
the past, amid all the details consequent on embarkation for
foreign service.
</p>

<p>
The medical examinations were over elsewhere; but there
were 'returns,' endless, as useless apparently, to be made up
and signed in duplicate; inspection of equipments; extra
kits at sea to be seen to, and dinner provided for the
embarking soldiers, the arms racked and two men per company
told off to look after them, extra dogs on the upper deck
to be pursued, caught, and sent ashore despite the
remonstrances of owners, with the excess of baggage; chests
piled upon chests were being sent down below, with bedding,
valises, uniform cases, bullock trunks, and tubs; the
knapsacks to be stowed away over the mess-tables, sentries
posted on the baggage-room and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Amid all this a buzz of conversation was in progress at
the break of the poop among soldiers and their friends,
some of whom had contrived to get on board, and to one
of these in which there was something absurd he could not
help listening.
</p>

<p>
'Sorr, is Tim Riley aboord?' asked a young Irish labourer,
looking anxiously and with a somewhat scared look about
him.
</p>

<p>
'Who the devil is Tim Riley?' asked a petty officer in
charge of the gangway.
</p>

<p>
The Irishman slunk back and addressed a somewhat
<i>insouciant</i>-looking English recruiting sergeant, with ribbons
fluttering from his cap, and whose business then could only
be to get a few stray 'grogs' before the bell sounded for
'shore.'
</p>

<p>
'Sergeant, dear, may be you know Tim Riley who inlisted
into the sogers?'
</p>

<p>
'Tim Riley?  How do you spell his name?'
</p>

<p>
'Devil a one of me knows, but he was a boy from Dublin.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, I knewed him well.  He's a colonel now,' replied
the sergeant.
</p>

<p>
'A colonel&mdash;oh, glory be to God!  Is it Tim, whose ears
I've warmed many a time for stealing the ould man's Scotch
apples?  Where is the shilling, sergeant?'
</p>

<p>
'Now be off and make an <i>omadhaun</i> of yourself,'said one
of the 18th.  'I knew Thady Boyle; he 'listed as a
captain&mdash;devil a less&mdash;in the Royal County Down, and when he
joined he was put in the black-hole by a spalpeen of an
English corporal.'
</p>

<p>
The bustle of the embarkation seemed endless, but at last
the bugle sounded, and a bell clanged for all visitors to quit
the ship; the various gangways were run ashore, the screw
began to revolve, and H.M.S. <i>Bannockburn</i> was off.
</p>

<p>
While the air seemed to vibrate with cheers, the great
white trooper, slowly and stately in aspect, came out of the
harbour between the Blockhouse Fort and the Round
Tower, and steamed abreast of the crowded Clarence
Esplanade, which was gay with people even at that season,
and there the soldiers, as they clustered like red bees on the
vessel's side and in the lower rigging, could see the troops
of jolly children with frocks and trousers tucked up paddling
in the water, so far as they dared venture, or making breakwaters
and fortifications of sand as actively as if they had to
defend the shores of old England.
</p>

<p>
Portsmouth, its spires, batteries, and ultramural line of
magnificent, but now obsolete, batteries and casemates, its
masts and shipping, was becoming shrouded in the golden
haze of evening, and the farewell greetings of the women on
board the harbour craft and those of the youthful tars of the
old <i>St. Vincent</i> had died away astern; but cheers rose in
volleys, if we may use the term, when the <i>Bannockburn</i>
neared Cowes, where the Queen&mdash;the Queen herself&mdash;was
known to be in the <i>Alberta</i> yacht, which had the Royal
Standard floating at her mainmast head, and every heart
beat high as the vessels neared each other, and the
Queen&mdash;a small figure in black&mdash;was seen amid a group waving
her handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
Roland had only two buglers on board, but these poured
forth the Royal Anthem with right good will from their
perch in the foretop, while instead of the boatswain's shrill
whistle the steam siren was sounded.  The Royal yacht
steamed round the towering trooper, which slackened speed,
and the signal fluttered out, 'You may proceed.'
</p>

<p>
Once more the hearty cheers responded to each other
over the water; again the little white handkerchief was seen
to wave as the yacht led the way down the Solent and
through Spithead, that famous reach and roadstead, the
rendezvous of our fleets in time of war.
</p>

<p>
'Farewell, God speed you!' came the signal from the
yacht once more, and the <i>Bannockburn</i> stood out to sea
under the lee of the beautiful Isle of Wight.
</p>

<p>
The boats were all finally secured; the anchors hauled
close up to the cat-heads by the cat-fall; the forecourse and
maintopsail were set to accelerate her speed, and the
troop-ship stood on her voyage down the Channel.
</p>

<p>
The high excitement of the last few hours had now completely
passed away.  On deck the half-hushed groups of
soldiers in their gray greatcoats were lingering, watching the
occasional twinkling of the shore lights, taking their last look
of old England; and when night had completely fallen, and
the bugles had blown tattoo, the Mother of Nations had
faded out in the distance as the ship gave the land a wide
berth.
</p>

<p>
Weary with the unintermitting toil and bustle of the day,
Roland, after mess, betook himself with a cigar to his own
little cabin; a small substitute certainly for the luxuries of
Earlshaugh, as was his sole retinue now, for the staff there;
his single soldier-servant by this time had made his bed,
arranged his toilette and sea-going kit, and put the entire
place in the most perfect order; and of old, Roland knew
well how invaluable a thorough soldier-servant is.
</p>

<p>
'What cannot he do with regulation pipe-clay?' it has
been asked.  'In his hands it is omnipotent over cloth.
He can charm stains and grease-spots thereout, even as an
Indian juggler charms snakes; and what sleight of hand he
exercises over your garments generally.  The tunic, grimed
and mud-bespattered, he can switch and cane, and, when
folded away, it comes out as from a press.  Trousers baggy
at the knees as the historical parachute of old Mrs. Gamp,
are manipulated into their former shape.  Compared to the
private valet, always expensive and frequently mutinous, he
is a pearl of the greatest price.  His cost is a dole, and,
thanks to the regimental guard-room, he can always be kept
within control.'
</p>

<p>
In the great cabin, which was brilliantly lighted still,
Roland heard the loud hum of many voices where the
jovial fellows he had left were lingering over their wine
and talking unlimited 'shop'&mdash;discussing everything, from
Lord Wolseley's supposed plan of the Soudan campaign to
the last fashion in regimental buttons.
</p>

<p>
How he envied the jollity and lightheartedness of his
brother-officers&mdash;Dick Mostyn in particular.
</p>

<p>
Dick had not lost an inheritance nor a false love to boot,
certainly; but it was nothing to him that his pockets were
well-nigh empty, his banker's account over-drawn, and that
he had debts innumerable, all but paid by the proverbial 'a
roll on the drum;' his talent for soothing irate tailors had
failed him; still his wardrobe was faultless; he still wore
priceless boots and irreproachable lavender kids as steadily
as he retained his step in the waltz and his seat in the
saddle, which would be of good service to him if he joined
the Mounted Infantry.  He could take nothing deeply to
heart, and even now, leading the van in Bacchanalian noise
and jollity&mdash;a verse of his song&mdash;it was from poor 'Tilbury
Nogo,' ran through the cabin, and just then it seemed
exactly to suit Roland's frame of mind as he lounged on a
sofa with his uniform jacket unbuttoned:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'I sigh not for woman, I want not her charms&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long waving tress, the melting black eye&mdash;<br />
  For the sting of the adder still lurks in her arms,<br />

CHAPTER XLV.
<br /><br />
THE DEATH WRESTLE.
</h3>

<p>
Tidings had come, as stated, to the zereba of Sheikh
Moussa of the deportation of his kinsman Zebehr in a
British ship of war as a State prisoner to Gibraltar, and
Malcolm Skene&mdash;no longer cared for as a hostage&mdash;found
himself in greater peril than before among his unscrupulous
captors.
</p>

<p>
He was conscious that his movements by day were
watched more closely than ever now, and by night he was
always placed in a close prison beyond the court wherein the
lions were chained.
</p>

<p>
Other Sheikhs came and went, with their standard-bearers
and horsemen; conferences were evidently held with
Moussa Abu Hagil; Skene found himself an object of growing
hostility, and suspected 'that something, he knew not
what,' was in progress; that Gordon had actually been
victorious or rescued at Khartoum, or some great battle had
been lost by the Mahdi.
</p>

<p>
He could gather from his knowledge of the language, and
the remarks that were let fall unwittingly in his hearing that
the zereba was to be abandoned for a general movement on
Khartoum, or for another fortified post farther up the
country&mdash;a move worse for him; and the consequent preparations,
therefore, packing tents, provisions, and spoil, had
begun.
</p>

<p>
To save further trouble, and gratify the lust of blood
which forms a part of the Oriental nature, he might be
assassinated after all&mdash;after having found protection under
the roof and eaten the salt of Moussa&mdash;killed as poor
Hector MacLaine was killed after the battle of Candahar,
two or three years before this time.
</p>

<p>
The expression of Moussa's face as he regarded him
occasionally now, was neither pleasant nor reassuring; his
deep set eyes, when he was excited, glared with fire, like
lights in the sockets of a skull; and Malcolm Skene never
knew when the supreme moment might come.
</p>

<p>
In the morning he had no assurance that he should see
night&mdash;in the night that he would be a live man in the
morning.
</p>

<p>
Anything&mdash;death itself&mdash;were better than this keen and
cruel suspense.
</p>

<p>
One evening about sunset there was a vehement beating
of tom-toms, and a body of Baggara Arabs, some on
horseback, others on camels, but many on foot&mdash;a fierce and
jabbering mob, all but nude&mdash;though well-armed with
bright-bladed Solingen swords and excellent Remington rifles,
passed the zereba, bound for some point of attack; and the
Sheikh Moussa, with every man he could muster, joined
them in hot haste.
</p>

<p>
So great had been the bustle and hurry of their departure
that Malcolm Skene, to his astonishment, found himself
forgotten, overlooked; and, full of hopeful thoughts, he lay
quiet and still in the poor apartment allotted to him,
watching the strange constellations and stars unknown to Europe
through the unglazed aperture that served as a window, and
listening to the silence&mdash;if we may use such a paradox&mdash;a
silence that seemed to be broken only by the pulsations of
his own heart, as hope grew up in it suddenly, and he
thought that, considering a kind of crisis that had come in
his fate, now or never was the time to make a stroke for
liberty, and to elude, if possible, the few Arabs who were
left to watch the gates in the dense mimosa hedge that
surrounded the zereba.
</p>

<p>
To elude them&mdash;but how?
</p>

<p>
The stars were singularly bright even for that hemisphere;
but there was no moon as yet, fortunately, and softly quitting
his hut, he looked sharply about the 'compound,' as it
would be called in India, and found himself alone there,
unnoticed and unseen.  He drew near the hedge in the
hope of finding, as he ultimately did, an opening in that
barrier, a thinner portion of its dense branches, close to the
ground, and at once he proceeded to creep through.
</p>

<p>
How easy it seemed of accomplishment just then; but
when the zereba was full of armed men, and watchers and
sentinels were numerous, the attempt would have been useless.
</p>

<p>
Slowly, softly, and scarcely making a twig or a thorn crack,
he drew himself through on his hands and face ere many
minutes passed; minutes? they could not have been more
than five, if so many; but with life trembling in the balance,
to poor Skene they seemed as ages.
</p>

<p>
At last he was through!
</p>

<p>
He was outside that hated place of confinement, every
feature of which he knew but too well, and every detail of
which he loathed; and yet he was not quite free.  Keen
eyes might see him after all, and every moment he expected
to hear an alarm.
</p>

<p>
He thanked Heaven for the absence of the moonlight,
and, favoured by the obscurity, crept on his hands and
knees for a considerable distance ere he ventured to stand
erect, to draw a long breath, and with a prayer of hope
and thankfulness on his lips, set out at a run towards the
Nile.
</p>

<p>
By the oft-studied landmarks he knew well in what direction
the great river lay, a few miles off, however.
</p>

<p>
A boat thereon, could he but find one, might be the means
of ultimate escape, by taking him lower down the stream to
more civilized regions.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, he could not be worse off, be in greater hourly
peril, or have a more dark future, than when in the
zereba, unless, too probably, thirst and starvation came
upon him.
</p>

<p>
While the darkness of night lasted, he had a certain chance
of safety and concealment, and he dared scarcely long for
day and the perils it might bring forth in a land where every
man's hand was certain to be against him.
</p>

<p>
He was totally defenceless, unarmed&mdash;oh, thought he,
for a weapon of any description, that he might strike, if not
a blow for liberty or life, at least one in defiance and for
vengeance!
</p>

<p>
So, full of vague and desperate yet hopeful ideas, he
pushed in the direction to where he knew the river lay.  On
its banks he hoped to obliterate or leave behind all trace of
his footsteps, for he knew but too well the risk he ran of
recapture on his flight or absence being discovered; and
that there were Arabs in the zereba who had applied themselves
diligently to the study of tracking or tracing the human
foot.
</p>

<p>
So acute are these men of vision that they can know
whether the footsteps belong to their own or to another
tribe, and consequently whether a friend or a foe has passed
that way; they know by the depth of the impression
whether the man bore a load or not; by the regularity of
the steps whether the man was fatigued or fresh and active,
and hence can calculate to a nicety the chances of
overtaking him; whether he has trodden in sand or on grass,
and bruised its blades, and by the appearance of the traces
whether the stranger had passed on that day or several days
before.
</p>

<p>
Malcolm Skene knew all this, and that with dawn they
would be like scenting beagles on his trail, hence his intense
anxiety to reach the river's bank.
</p>

<p>
Swiftly the dawn came in, red and fiery, and his own
shadow and the shadows of every object were cast far
behind him.  He looked back again and again; no sign of
pursuit was in his rear.  In the distance he saw a few Arab
huts with <i>sakias</i> or water-wheels, and then with something
like a start of joy that elicited an exclamation, he got a
glimpse of the river, rolling clear and blue, its banks a stripe
of narrow green, between the rocky, rugged, inexorable
black mountains; but there no boat floated on and no sail
whitened the yellowish blue of the Nile.  But the morning
light was vivid, the breeze from the river was pleasant and
exultant, the glories of Nature were around him, yet anxiety
made him gasp for breath as he struggled forward.
</p>

<p>
Not a bird or other living thing was visible.  The silence
was intense, and not even an insect hummed amid the scrub
mimosas; the hot, red sun came up in his unclouded glory.
All seemed sad, solitary, yet intensely sunny.
</p>

<p>
Ere long he did hear a sound of life; it was the shrill cry
of a little naked boy attending on a <i>sakia</i> wheel.  Irrigation
is done by the latter, which is driven by oxen turning a
chain of water-jars, which admits of being lengthened as the
river falls.  It is usually enclosed in an edifice like an old
tower, green with creeping plants, and as the boy drives the
oxen, his cry and the creaking of the great wheel are sounds
that never cease, day or night, by the Nile.
</p>

<p>
To avoid this <i>sakia</i> and its too probable surroundings or
adjuncts, Malcolm Skene turned aside into a rocky chasm
that overhung the river at a considerable height, and then,
far down below, on the blue surface of the stream and
between its banks, which in some places were barred in by
rocks, blackened by the sun and rent by volcanic throes
into strange fragments, and which in others, where the desert
touched the stream, was bordered by level sand, he saw a
sight which, were he to live a thousand years, he thought he
could never, never forget!
</p>

<p>
There, about half a mile distant, was a regular flotilla of
boats, manned by redcoats, with sails set and oars
out&mdash;broad-bladed oars that flashed like silver as they were
feathered in the sunshine, pulled steadily against the
downward current of the river, and all apparently advancing
merrily within talking distance&mdash;a sight that made his heart
leap within his breast, for he knew that this was a relieving
column, or part of it, <i>en route</i> for Khartoum!
</p>

<p>
For a minute he stood still, as if he could scarcely believe
his senses, or that he was not dreaming&mdash;paralysed, as it
were, with this sudden joy and sight&mdash;one far, far beyond
his conception or hope of ever being realised.
</p>

<p>
He stretched his tremulous hands towards these advancing
boats; he fancied he could hear the voices and see
the faces of the oarsmen in their white helmets and red
coats; and never did 'the old red rag that tells of Britain's
glory' seem more dear to his eye and more dear to his heart
than at that supreme moment!
</p>

<p>
What force might already have passed up?
</p>

<p>
How many days had they been passing, and if so, how
narrowly had he escaped being left behind?  This was
assuredly the Khartoum Expedition, or part of it, and the
recent bustle, consternation, and excitement at the zereba of
Moussa Abu Hagil were quite accounted for now.
</p>

<p>
The sight of his comrades imbued him with renewed
strength of mind and purpose, and his whole soul became
inspired with new impatience, hope, and joy&mdash;hope on the
eve of fulfilment.
</p>

<p>
While looking about for a means of descent to the river
bank, from whence to attract the attention of the nearest
crew, he heard a sound like a mocking laugh or ironical
shout.  He turned and looked back, and&mdash;with what
emotions may be imagined, but not described&mdash;he beheld a
man clad like an Arab, and covering him with a levelled rifle,
at about a hundred yards' distance.
</p>

<p>
The condition of his uniform&mdash;in tatters long since&mdash;had
not been improved by the thorns of the prickly zereba hedge
in his passage through it; his helmet had since given place
to a tarboosh, and, all unkempt and unshorn, his aspect was
somewhat remarkable now, but quite familiar to Pietro
Girolamo&mdash;for Girolamo it was&mdash;who knew him in an
instant.
</p>

<p>
Whether the revengeful Greek had tracked him or not, or
whether Moussa's followers were within hearing of a musket-shot,
Skene might never know; the fact was but too evident
that, intent on death and dire mischief, the Ionian Isleman
and <i>ci-devant</i> gambling-den keeper was there, with his white,
pallid visage, fierce hawk nose, long jetty moustache, and
gleaming black eyes.
</p>

<p>
Every detail of his tantalising and most critical position
flashed on the mind of Malcolm Skene.
</p>

<p>
On one hand were the boats of the River Column&mdash;life
and freedom!
</p>

<p>
On the other, death&mdash;no captivity, but death, certain and
sure; for even if he escaped Girolamo, in the direction where
the zereba lay he could now see a cloud of dust, and amid it
the dusky figures of men and camels, with the gleam of
burnished steel, and then within almost his grasp, was
Girolamo, rifle in hand, arresting his path to the boats.
</p>

<p>
With another mocking laugh, the Greek levelled his
weapon more surely, took aim, and fired.
</p>

<p>
Skene heard&mdash;yes, felt&mdash;the bullet whiz past his ear.
Powerless, defenceless, unarmed, his heart burned with rage
and desperation at the narrow escape his life had; but
discretion and scheming were then the better part of valour,
and, with thought that came upon him quick as a flash of
lightning, instead of risking another discharge, he resolved
to feign death, and, after reeling round as if shot, he fell on
the ground.
</p>

<p>
Then he heard the steps of his would be assassin approach
ing him slowly and steadily, to give a <i>coup de grace</i> if requisite
with his knife, perhaps, rather than to seek plunder, as Skene,
he knew, would possess nothing worth taking.
</p>

<p>
Restraining his breath till the Greek was close upon him,
Skene lay still; and then, as the former was about to stoop,
he sprang to his feet and confronted him.  So startled was
Girolamo by this unexpected movement that the rifle
dropped from his hand, slipped over the rocks, and the two
enemies were face to face on equal terms, for Girolamo was
minus knife or poniard.
</p>

<p>
He clenched his teeth; his glittering eyes blazed; his long,
lean fingers were curled like the claws of a kite; and he
uttered strange, guttural sounds of astonishment and rage;
but Skene had no time to lose.
</p>

<p>
Straight out from the shoulder he planted his left fist,
clenched, with a dull thud on the hooked beak of Girolamo,
followed by a similar application of his right, and knocked
him with a crash on the rocks.
</p>

<p>
Agile as a tiger and blindly infuriated like one, the Greek
sprang again to his feet, and was rushing forward like a mad
thing to get Skene's throat in the grasp of his long and
powerful fingers, which would speedily have strangled the
life out of him, but the latter bestowed upon his antagonist
another 'facer,' which sent more than one of his sharp teeth
rattling down his throat and loosened many of the rest,
covering his pale face with blood; but, blinded by fury&mdash;a
fury that endowed his wiry form with double strength&mdash;he
closed in, and contrived to encircle Skene in his grasp&mdash;an
iron one; for, long accustomed to a seafaring life, his
muscles and nerves were like bands of steel, and now came
the tug of war, even while distant cries came to the ears of
the wrestlers.
</p>

<p>
No sound escaped either now, but hard and concentrated
breathing; it was a struggle for death or for life, and each
scarcely paused a moment to glare into the other's eyes.
Fiercely as the first of his race and name is said to have
grappled with the wolf in the wilds of Stocket Forest, did
Skene grapple with his athletic adversary.
</p>

<p>
Near the edge of the rocks that overhung the river at the
end of the chasm, backwards and forwards they swayed,
locked in a savage and deadly grasp.  Finding that every
effort to uproot Skene, to get him off his legs and throw
him, so that he might resort to strangulation, proved
unavailing, he strove to drag him towards the Nile, in the
hope of flinging him down the bank; but whether the said
bank was a precipice of a hundred feet or only the drop
of a few yards Skene knew not, and in the blind fury
of the moment, with pursuers coming on, never thought
of it.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer the verge, by sheer strength of muscle
and weight of limb, the Greek was dragging him, and
already some shouts in English ascending from the bosom
of the river evinced that the struggle was visible from the
boats; but Skene now gave up all hope of being able to
conquer his opponent or free himself from his terrible
grasp, and had but one thought&mdash;that if he perished, Pietro
Girolamo should perish too!
</p>

<p>
Now they were at the edge, the verge of what was
evidently a precipice of considerable height, and more
fiercely and breathlessly than ever did they wrench, sway,
and grasp each other, their arms tightening, as hatred, rage,
and ferocious dread grew apace together&mdash;the clamorous
dread that one might escape the doom he meant to mete
out to or compel the other to share with him.
</p>

<p>
As last a species of gasping sigh escaped them.  Both
lost their footing at once and fell for a moment through the
air; they then crashed upon bushes and stones, and without
relaxing their grasp rolled over and over each other
with awful speed down a precipitous steep, sending before
and bringing after them showers of gravel and little stones,
crashing through mimosa bushes and other scrub, maimed,
bruised, and covered with each other's blood, for some forty
feet or so.
</p>

<p>
Mad was the thirst for each other's destruction that
inspired these two men; for Malcolm Skene, by the peril and
circumstances of the time, was reduced to the level of the
Ionian savage with whom he fought&mdash;if fighting it could be
called.
</p>

<p>
Another moment and they had rolled into the Nile&mdash;a
fall, ere it was accomplished, that in a second seemed to
compress and contain the epitome of life, and down they
went under the surface, cleaving the water at a rate that
seemed to take all power out of heart and limb, and, parting,
they rose at a little distance from each other.
</p>

<p>
Faint and breathless Skene went down again, water bubbling
in his eyes, choking in his throat, and all breath had
left him ere he rose to the surface again, and saw Girolamo
clinging to a rock round which swept the beginning of a
rapid.  He was visible for a moment only; exhaustion
made him relax his hold.  He sank, rose again only to sink;
then a hand was visible once or twice above the water as he
was swept away into eternity by the fierce current that
bubbled round the sun-baked rocks.
</p>

<p>
Then Skene felt hands laid upon him, and while English
voices and exclamations came pleasantly to his half-dulled
ears, he was dragged by soldiers on board one of the
boats, where he lay so completely exhausted as to be almost
insensible; and he had not fallen into the river a moment
too soon, for, just as he did so, a group of armed Arabs,
the followers of Moussa Abu Hagil, crowned with a spluttering
fire of musketry, and with wild gesticulations, the rocks
above the Nile.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLVI.
<br /><br />
MAUDE'S VISITOR.
</h3>

<p>
'The lives of some families,' it is said, 'are exactly like a
pool in which&mdash;without being exactly stagnant&mdash;nothing
occurs to ruffle the surface of the water from year's end to
year's end, and then come a series of tremendous splashes,
like naughty boys throwing stones.'
</p>

<p>
So it was with the Lindsays of Earlshaugh latterly, as we
will soon have to show.
</p>

<p>
The few weeks of his leave of absence that intervened
before Jack Elliot would have inexorably to start for Egypt,
glided happily and all too swiftly away, when he and Maude
took up their residence at the pretty villa in the southern
quarter of Edinburgh, near the ancient Grange Loan; and
often if they sat silent, or lingered hand in hand amid the
faded flower-beds of the garden, they seemed to be only
listening&mdash;if one may say so&mdash;to the silent responses of their
own hearts, and that language of instinct understood only
by kindred souls.
</p>

<p>
'We have not exactly Aladdin's lamp in the house,
Maude,' said Jack laughingly, 'nor have we all the luxuries
of our future home at Braidielee, where now conservatories
are springing up, a billiard-room being built, and gardens
laid out, all for you; but we are happy as people can
be&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Who have a coming separation to face and to endure,
Jack,' she interrupted, with a break in her voice.
</p>

<p>
In the newspapers they read the announcement of the
marriage, at Earlshaugh, of 'Hawkey Sharpe, Esq., to Miss
Annot Drummond, of South Belgravia,' at which Jack
laughed loud and long.
</p>

<p>
'Well, Roland <i>is</i> lucky to be out of the running there!&mdash;Sharpe,
Esq.&mdash;I wonder he did not add "of Earlshaugh,"
and doubtless the creature would figure in all Roland's
splendid jewels and gifts.  Pah!' said he; but the gentle
Maude had a kind of pity for the girl, and her views of the
matter were somewhat mingled.
</p>

<p>
Annot's mother had toiled always in the matrimonial
market&mdash;long unaided by the young lady herself&mdash;and now
the latter had landed a golden fish at last, as she thought, in
the future heir of Earlshaugh&mdash;Mr. Hawkey Sharpe!
</p>

<p>
No longer was she to be perplexed by questions how few
or how many thousand a year had such as Bob Hoyle, and
on other delicate matters dear to the Belgravian mater, and
concerning 'detrimentals.'  After more than one season
spent in the chase, after dinners that were too costly for a
limited exchequer, handsome dresses and much showy
appearance, laborious days and watchful nights, snubs and
disappointments&mdash;<i>homme propose, femme dispose</i>&mdash;Annot
was fairly off her hands, and to be a 'Lady of that
Ilk.'
</p>

<p>
She had played her cards in Scotland beautifully!
</p>

<p>
And now came to pass the event which ruffled the calm
pool of Maude's existence, when within three days of
Elliot's departure to rejoin the army in Egypt.  The crisis
from which she ever shrank seemed now to have come!
</p>

<p>
Oftentimes before this had she wondered whether it were
possible such unbroken happiness as her present life would
ever come again, despite the tender, earnest, and trusting
love that glowed in her breast; and on one particular
evening, when Jack Elliot was absent making some final
preparations, and would not be home till late, she sat alone,
striving to prepare herself for the change, the solitude and
anxiety that were to come, and praying tearfully for strength
to pass the bitter ordeal&mdash;the wrench that was before them
both.
</p>

<p>
This happy, happy honeymoon of a few weeks was drawing
to its close, and her soft blue eyes grew very full as she
thought over the whole situation, when a visitor was suddenly
announced.
</p>

<p>
A showily-dressed and smart-looking little woman, about
thirty years of age apparently, rather pretty, but flippant and
nervous in manner, and having a slight <i>soupçon</i> of 'making-up'
about her cheeks and eyelashes, was ushered in, and
eyed, with some boldness and effrontery (to conceal the
nervousness referred to), Maude, who, by force of habit,
bowed and indicated a seat, which her visitor at once took,
and threw up her veil.
</p>

<p>
Maude saw that her features were good, but this colouring
and expression made them cunning and daring, if somewhat
remarkable and attractive.
</p>

<p>
Maude then remembering that this person had not sent
in a card or announced herself, inquired to what she owed
the occasion of her visit.
</p>

<p>
'The occasion&mdash;you'll soon know that&mdash;too soon for
your own peace of mind, poor girl!  You are&mdash;Miss
Lindsay?'
</p>

<p>
'I was Miss Lindsay,' replied Maude.
</p>

<p>
'And who are you now?'
</p>

<p>
Maude stared at her visitor with some alarm.
</p>

<p>
'If you take an interest in Captain Elliot, it is a pity,'
continued the latter.
</p>

<p>
'Interest&mdash;pity?' questioned Maude, rising now, and
drawing near to the handle of the bell.
</p>

<p>
'Take my advice in time, and don't touch that!' said her
strange visitor with sudden insolence of manner, while
something of malevolence and triumph sparkled in her dark
eyes.
</p>

<p>
'You must be mad, or&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Tipsy, you would say&mdash;I am neither; but I have that to
say which you may not wish to furnish gossip for your
servants, so do not summon them until I am gone.'
</p>

<p>
'Will you be so kind as to state at once the object of
your visit?' said Maude, with as much hauteur as she could
summon to her aid.
</p>

<p>
'So you are his wife&mdash;a doll like you!  Mrs. Elliot of
Braidielee, you think yourself!' said the woman mockingly;
'I fear I have that to tell which your dainty ears will not
find very pleasant.  But "gather ye rosebuds while ye
may;" for ere long only the leaves, dead and without
fragrance, will be left you!'
</p>

<p>
Maude felt herself grow pale and tremble; she knew that
there was a great lunatic asylum somewhere in that quarter
of the city, and began to fear that her visitor was an escaped
patient.  She moved a step towards the bell again, and cast
a lingering, longing glance at it, on which the woman again
said sharply:
</p>

<p>
'Don't!  Listen to me, I tell you!'
</p>

<p>
Placing her elbows on a small Chippendale table, off
which, without ceremony, she thrust a few books, she rested
her chin upon her left hand, and looking at the shrinking
Maude steadily and defiantly&mdash;for the perfect purity of the
girl, her position in life, her whole aspect and bearing filled
this fallen one&mdash;for fallen she was&mdash;with rivalry, envy, and
hatred, she asked:
</p>

<p>
'Now, who do you think I am?'
</p>

<p>
'That I have yet to learn,' replied Maude, who was
moving towards the door, when the next words of the
woman arrested her steps.
</p>

<p>
'Learn that I am Captain John Elliot's&mdash;lawful wife!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh&mdash;she is mad!' thought Maude, who neither tottered,
nor fainted, nor made any outcry, deeming the bold
assertion as totally absurd.
</p>

<p>
'You don't believe me, I suppose?'
</p>

<p>
'You must hold me excused if I do not,' replied Maude,
thinking that she must temporise with a woman who, for all
she knew, might bite her like a rabid dog; for poor Maude
had very vague ideas of the ways and proclivities of lunatics
in general.
</p>

<p>
She had but one desire, to rush past, to gain the door and
escape; but was baffled by the expression of the woman's
watchful black eyes.  That she was not and never had been
a lady was evident; neither did she seem of the servant
class; so Maude's inexperienced eye was unable to fix her
place in the scale of society, though her costume was
good&mdash;if showy&mdash;even to her well-fitting gloves.
</p>

<p>
'You would wish to see my marriage-lines, I doubt not,'
said the visitor with a smile, drawing a couple of folded
papers from her bosom; 'but perhaps you had better read
this first.  I am a great believer in documentary evidence,
and hope you are so too.'
</p>

<p>
Somewhat ostentatiously she flattened out a letter on the
table, but carefully kept her hands thereon, as if in fear
that it might be snatched away by Maude; and impelled by
an impressible but hideous emotion of curiosity the latter
drew near, and the woman with a slender forefinger traced
out the lines she wished her to read&mdash;lines that seemed to
seal the fate of Maude, whose dull eyes wandered over
them like one in a dreadful dream&mdash;for the letter, if a
forgery, was certainly to all appearance in the handwriting
of Jack Elliot, and some of its peculiarities in the formation
of capitals and certain other letters seemed to her too
terribly familiar and indisputable.
</p>

<p>
They seemed to sear the girl's brain&mdash;the words she read&mdash;but
summoning all her self-control, and seeming scarcely
to breathe, she permitted as yet no expression of sorrow, of
passion, or emotion of any kind to escape her.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
'DEAREST LITTLE WIFE,
</p>

<p>
'I write you, Maggie, as I promised, as I cannot see
you before leaving for Egypt, and fear the sorrow of such
another parting as our last may kill me, for you know that
all the love of my heart is yours, though I have been
entrapped into a marriage with Maude Lindsay&mdash;a mad
entanglement, for which I ask your forgiveness and pity,
that you may not bring me to punishment and shame.  I
will buy your silence at any price; let me have back the
marriage certificate and all letters, and I herewith enclose a
blank cheque for you to fill up at your pleasure.  This I
do, dear little one, for the sake of our old&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Here Maude reeled, for the room seemed to revolve round
her.
</p>

<p>
'There!' said this odious woman exultingly, as she
hastened to refold the letter and replace it in her breast,
'will you deny it longer?'
</p>

<p>
The speaker showed neither the certificate nor the blank
cheque; but poor Maude had seen enough.  She fainted,
and when she recovered her obnoxious visitor was
gone&mdash;gone, but had left a dreadful sting behind.
</p>

<p>
Had her presence and her story been all a dream?  No!
There was the chair in which she had been seated; there
was the little Chippendale table on which she had spread
the terrible letter that told of Jack's perfidy; and there on
the floor, just where she had thrown or thrust them, lay the
scattered books&mdash;his presents in the past time.
</p>

<p>
She cast herself on the sofa&mdash;she could neither think nor
weep; her heart beat painfully&mdash;every pulsation was a
pang!  What was she to do&mdash;whither turn for advice before
madness came upon her?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Well, my old duck, Maggie, you have earned your
money fairly, by all accounts&mdash;and my wonderful caligraphy
was quite a success!' said Hawkey Sharpe, exploding
with laughter, when he heard the narration of his 'fair'
compatriot or conspirator, as he handed her a twenty-pound
note, and drove with her townward in the cab with which
he had awaited the termination of her visit at the Grange
Loan.  'By Jove! a pleasant home-coming that fellow will
have!  "All men are brothers," says the minister of
Earlshaugh; Cains and Abels, say I.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't care about him or what he may suffer&mdash;you men
are all alike, a bad, false, cruel lot,' replied the woman;
'but, with all her airs and graces, her haughtiness and her
touch-me-not manner, I <i>am</i> sorry for what that poor girl
may be&mdash;nay, must be&mdash;enduring now.'
</p>

<p>
'The devil you are! all things are fair in love and war&mdash;and
this is <i>war</i>!' said Hawkey, still continuing his bursts of
malignant laughter; 'would she care for what you might
endure?'
</p>

<p>
'I am sure she would&mdash;her face and her voice were so
sweet and gentle.'
</p>

<p>
'For all that she would draw aside her skirt if it touched
yours, as though there was a taint in the contact.'
</p>

<p>
The woman made no reply, but glared at him with defiant
malevolence in her bold black eyes, and now seemed
shocked at the very act which, a few minutes before, had
given her much malignant satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
But we have not heard the last of Mr. Hawkey Sharpe's
skill in caligraphy.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLVII.
<br /><br />
THE RESULT.
</h3>

<p>
Sense returned to the unhappy creature ere her servants
discovered her or knew that the mysterious visitor had departed.
</p>

<p>
'It cannot be!  It cannot have happened&mdash;it is too
dreadful&mdash;too cruel!' she repeated to herself again and
again; but could she doubt the tenor of the letter she had
seen and read&mdash;the letter in her husband's own handwriting?
'Oh, Heaven!' she murmured; 'our days together have
been so blithesome and so happy, even when their brightest
hours were clouded by a separation to come; but Oh, not
such a separation as this!  What have I done that God
deems me so unworthy&mdash;that I am tortured, punished thus?'
</p>

<p>
'There is scarcely in the whole sad world,' it is said, 'and
in the woeful scale of mental suffering, aught sadder than
the helpless struggle of a poor human heart against a
crushing load of misery, strengthening itself in its despair,
taking courage from the extremity of its wretchedness in the
frenzied whispers of reassurance.'
</p>

<p>
Thus did Maude continue to whisper to herself: 'It
cannot be&mdash;it cannot be!'
</p>

<p>
She passed her hot hand several times across her
throbbing forehead; her brain was too confused&mdash;too
unable yet to grapple with this disillusion, the miserable
situation, and with all the new and sudden horrors of her
false and now degraded position in the world&mdash;in society,
and in life!
</p>

<p>
She had heard stories; she had vague ideas of the
temptations to which young men&mdash;young officers more than
all&mdash;are subjected; and Jack might have been the victim of
some hour of weakness, or evil, or treachery.
</p>

<p>
Holding by the bannisters, she ascended to her bedroom&mdash;<i>their</i>
room, as it was but one short hour ago&mdash;and there
on every hand were souvenirs of Jack which had once
seemed so strange amid the appurtenances of her toilet; the
slippers she had worked for him were under the
dressing-table; his razors and brushes lay thereon; his pipes littered
the mantelpiece; and his portmanteaux and helmet-case,
ready for Egypt, stood in a corner.
</p>

<p>
Novels Maude had read, plays she had seen, stories she
had heard of, in which concealed marriages and other
horrors had been amply detailed; and in the heart of one of
these episodes she now found herself, as they crowded on
her memory with bewildering force and pain.
</p>

<p>
She strove to think, to gather her thoughts, in vain.
Jack could not be so vile, and yet there was that
letter&mdash;that horrible letter!
</p>

<p>
'If this woman is his wife&mdash;what then am I?  Oh, horror
and misery&mdash;horror and misery!' thought Maude, covering
her face with her tremulous hands, while the hot tears
gushed between her slender fingers.
</p>

<p>
Was all this happening to her or to some one else?  She
almost doubted her own identity&mdash;the evidence of her
senses.  A moment or two she lingered at a window
wistfully looking over the landscape, which she had often
viewed from thence with Jack's arm round her, and her
head on his shoulder, watching dreamily the light of the
setting sun falling redly on the long wavy slope of the lovely
Pentlands, or the nearer hills of Braid, so green and pastoral,
the scene of Johnnie of Braidislee's doleful hunting in the
ancient time, and where in a lone and wooded hollow lies the
dreary Hermitage beside the Burn, haunted, it is said, in the
present day by the unquiet spirit of the beautiful Countess
of Stair, the victim of a double and repudiated marriage, and
whose wrongs were of the days when George IV. was king;
and now as Maude looked, the farewell rays of the sun were
fading out on the summit of bluff Blackford, the haunt of
Scott's boyhood, and then the sober hues of twilight followed.
Of the hill he wrote:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Blackford! on whose uncultured breast<br />
  A truant boy I sought the nest,<br />
  Or listed as I lay at rest;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While rose on breezes thin<br />
  The murmur of the city crowd:<br />
  And from his steeple jangling loud<br />
  St. Giles's mingling din.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'All is over and ended&mdash;God help me!' wailed the girl
many times as she wrung her white and slender hands, and
yet prepared nervously and quickly to take measures that
were stern and determined.  There seemed to be a strange
loneliness in the sunset landscape as she turned from it, and
thought how beautiful, yet cruel and terrible, the world of
life can be, and choking sobs rose in her throat.
</p>

<p>
Should she await Jack's return&mdash;face him out and demand
an explanation?  No, a thousand times no; there seemed
degradation in receiving one.  Her resolution was taken;
she would leave now and for ever, and now with the coming
night a long journey to London was to be faced&mdash;to London,
where she would quickly be lost to all the world that knew
her once.
</p>

<p>
Jack would not be home (home!) for hours yet, but no
time was to be lost, and action of any kind was grateful to
her tortured spirit.
</p>

<p>
She quickly dressed herself for travelling; reckoned over
what was in her purse, and what was in her desk, and for
more than an hour sat writing&mdash;writing endless and incoherent
letters of farewell and upbraiding&mdash;letters which she
tore in minute fragments by the score, as none of them
seemed suitable to the awful occasion.  At last she feverishly
ended one; placed it in an envelope, addressed it&mdash;oh how
tremulously!&mdash;and placed it on the toilet table, where he was
sure to find it when she would be far away.
</p>

<p>
'I now know all&mdash;all about "Maggie!"' ran the letter.
('Who the devil is Maggie?' thought the terrified and
bewildered Jack when he <i>did</i> come, to peruse it.)
</p>

<p>
'You cannot forget that I once loved you&mdash;that I love
you still, when&mdash;oh, my God!&mdash;I have no right to do so,
nor can you forget the misery that obliges me to take this
step and leave you.  Oh, Jack!  Jack!
</p>

<p>
'God forgive you, but you have broken my heart!
</p>

<p>
'When you read this, Jack, I shall be gone&mdash;gone to
London or elsewhere&mdash;to where you shall never be able to
follow or to trace me in my hiding place.
</p>

<p>
'The horrors of a public scandal must be avoided; but
how, and however cautious our mode of action?'
</p>

<p>
'I shall never see you more&mdash;never from this evening;
never again hope for a renewal of happiness; and yet with
all your perfidy, Jack, your memory will always be most
precious to me, and I only fear I shall always love you too
well!'
</p>

<p>
Much more in the same incoherent style followed.
</p>

<p>
Time was short; she moved about noiselessly.  She
drew sharply off her bracelet and brooch, which were gifts
of Jack's; she did more; she drew off her wedding ring
with its keeper, her engagement ring also, and placed them
in another envelope; she put a few necessary garments and
toilet appurtenances into a travelling-bag, stole from the
house, found a cab, and ordered the man to drive her at
once to the railway station for London.
</p>

<p>
It was night, now, and the silent suburbs had been left
behind, and the cab, swift and well-horsed, and all unlike a
London 'crawler,' bowled through the busy streets that
were flooded with light.
</p>

<p>
She was off&mdash;the die was cast!  Nothing occurred to
hinder or delay her, nor did she wish for any such thing at
that time.
</p>

<p>
It was not too late to return; but why should she
return&mdash;and to <i>whom</i>?&mdash;'Maggie's' husband? and she set her
little teeth firmly and defiantly, as she was driven along the
platform of the Waverley Station, with the city lights
towering high in the air above her, and where the train that
was to bear her away was all in readiness for starting.
</p>

<p>
A new but unnatural kind of life seemed opening up to
her, and under her thick Shetland veil her hot tears welled
freely.  Until she was quite alone now, she knew not what
a feature Jack had been in her life, what an influence his
presence had upon her; and now their days of earnest and
peaceful love were over, and his whispers of endearment
would fall upon her ear no more.  Withal, she had a
stunned feeling, and she began to accept her present
position as if it was the result of something that had
happened long, long ago, with a kind of desperate resignation
and grim indifference as to what her own future might
bring forth.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLVIII.
<br /><br />
'INFIRM OF PURPOSE!'
</h3>

<p>
The night, one of the last of autumn, was very cold.  She
had secured a compartment to herself, fortunately; but
there was no kind hand to adjust her rugs, to see that the
foot-warmer was hot, to provide her with amusing periodicals,
or attend to her little comforts in any way.  She did not
miss them, but she missed Jack.
</p>

<p>
All her actions were mechanical, and it was not until she
was fairly away in the last train for the South, and had
emerged from the Gallon Tunnel, leaving Edinburgh with
all its lights and lofty mansions behind, that she quite knew
she was&mdash;vague and desperate of purpose&mdash;on her way to
London.
</p>

<p>
As the hours dragged slowly on&mdash;so slowly in strange
contrast to the lightning-like speed of the clanking train
that bore her away&mdash;she thought, would she ever forget
that dreadful and hopeless night journey&mdash;in itself a
nightmare&mdash;fleeing from all she loved, or had loved her, with no
future to realise?  Would she ever forget that dreadful,
mocking woman, with her painted cheeks and cunning
black eyes&mdash;her letter and her visit, every incident and
detail of which seemed photographed in her heart and on
her brain?
</p>

<p>
Mentally she conned over and thought&mdash;till her head
grew weary&mdash;of the letter she was to write Roland on the
subject, and how this new distress must pain and shock
him.
</p>

<p>
On, on went the train; the stars shone bright in the
moonless sky; the smoke of the engine streamed far
behind, and strange splashes of weird light were cast on
hedges, fields, and trees, on bank cuttings and other
features on either side of the way.
</p>

<p>
Now she had a glimpse of Dunbar, with its square church
tower of red sandstone; now it was Colbrands-path, with all
its wild woods and ravines; anon it was the German Sea,
near Fast Castle, rolling its free waves in white foam against
steep and frowning precipices; and a myriad lights gleaming
on the broad river far down below announced the bordering
Tweed at Berwick, and Scotland was left behind.
</p>

<p>
She lowered the windows from time to time, for her
temples felt hot and feverish.  She seemed to have nothing
left her now but light and air, and just then the former was
absent and the latter choking; and to her tortured soul life
had but lately seemed so beautiful.
</p>

<p>
'How proud I was of his love! oh happy, happy days
that can return no more!' were her ever recurrent thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Yet such love as he had professed for her had been but
a disgrace and a sham!  With all her affection, earnest and
true, when she reflected how far he must have gone, and so
daringly, out of his way to deceive her, and to throw dust
in the eyes of her and her brother Roland, she felt one
moment inclined to hate and scorn him, and the next her
heart died within her at such a state of matters; and, with
all her shattered trust, love came back again&mdash;but love for
what&mdash;for <i>whom</i>?
</p>

<p>
Then came other thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Why had she been so precipitate?  What if the whole
apparent catastrophe was some dire but explainable
mistake?  Why had she not consulted Hester, who was so
clever, so gentle, and loving, and her old uncle, Sir Harry?
But he was old and sorely ailing now.
</p>

<p>
<i>Infirm of purpose</i>, she began to fear that she had been
perhaps too rash, and starting up, as if she would leave the
carriage, she began to think&mdash;to think already&mdash;that to
undo all she had done, she would give her right hand.
</p>

<p>
Her left&mdash;it bore no wedding-ring now.  She looked at
her watch&mdash;midnight; long ere this Jack must have known
that she had discovered all!
</p>

<p>
Morning drew on, and in its colder, purer air and
atmosphere her thoughts seemed to become clearer, and as the
train glided on through the flat and monotonous scenery of
England she began to consider the possibility that she
might have been deceived&mdash;that she had been too swift in
avenging her wrongs, or supposed wrongs&mdash;and this
impression grew with the growing brightness of the reddening
dawn, and with that impulsiveness which was characteristic
of her, an hour even before the dawn came, she resolved
that she would return&mdash;she would face the calamity out;
she would cast herself upon her friends&mdash;not on the world;
but how to stop the train, which flew on and on, inexorably
on past station after station, every one of which seemed
almost dark and deserted.
</p>

<p>
The steam was let off suddenly; the speed of the train
grew slower and slower; it stopped at last in an open and
sequestered place, on an embankment overlooking a great
stretch of darkened, dimly seen, and flat country, half
shrouded, as usual, in haze and mist.
</p>

<p>
Heads in travelling caps and strange gear were thrust
from every window; inquiries were made anxiously and
angrily; but no answer was accorded; the officials seemed
all to have become very deaf and intensely sullen, while no
passenger could alight, as every door was securely locked, to
their alarm and indignation.
</p>

<p>
There was evidently an accident or a breakdown&mdash;a
block on the line somewhere, no one knew precisely what.
Signals were worked and lights flashed to avert destruction
from the front or rear, and when the rush of a coming train
was heard, 'the boldest held his breath for a time,' till it
swept past&mdash;an express&mdash;on another line of rails.
</p>

<p>
If she were killed&mdash;smashed up horribly like people she
had often read of in railways accidents, would Jack be sorry
for her?  There was a kind of revengeful pleasure in the
thought, the conviction that he would be, even while she
dropped a few natural tears over her own untimely demise.
</p>

<p>
The excitement grew apace.  The next train might <i>not</i>
be on the other line, and the mental agony of the travellers
lasted for more than an hour&mdash;an hour of terror and misery,
and of the wildest impatience to Maude, who in the tumult
of her spirits would have welcomed the crash, the destruction,
and, so far as she was personally concerned, the death
by a collision, to end everything.
</p>

<p>
At last the steam was got up again, and slowly the train
glided into the brilliant station at York just as dawn was
reddening the square towers of its glorious minster, and the
pale girl sprang out on the platform to find that the train for
Edinburgh had passed nearly two hours before, and that she
would have to wait&mdash;to wait for hours with what patience
she could muster.
</p>

<p>
Great was the evil and distress Hawkey Sharpe, in a spirit
of useless revenge, had wrought her.
</p>

<p>
How slow the returning train was&mdash;oh, how slow!  It
seemed to stop everywhere, and to be no sooner off than it
stopped again.  Stations hitherto unnoticed had apparently
sprung up like mushrooms in the night, and the platforms
were crowded with people perpetually getting in or going
out.
</p>

<p>
How long ago it seemed since last night&mdash;since that
fatal visit, and since she left her pretty home, if home it
was.
</p>

<p>
Even then, in the dire confusion and muddle of her
thoughts, they lingered lovingly on the apparently remote
memory of the happiest period of her young life&mdash;the
day when Jack Elliot first said he loved her, and she
had the joy of believing him to be entirely her own, to go
hand-in-hand with through the long years that were to
come&mdash;and now&mdash;now!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Looking forward to ample explanations from him, perhaps
an entire reconciliation with him if these explanations
were complete&mdash;or she knew not what&mdash;how the revolving
wheels of the train seemed to lag!  Then she would
close her tear-inflamed eyes and strive not to think at
all.
</p>

<p>
Already the Lion mountain of Arthur Seat, and the
Gallon with its Grecian columns, were rising into sight, and
she would soon be at her destination.
</p>

<p>
To save appearances even before her servants&mdash;a somewhat
useless consideration then&mdash;as even without the usual
sharpness of their class they must now be aware of the fact
that something unpleasant was on the <i>tapis</i>, and that their
mistress had, unexplainedly, been absent from her own home
for a whole night and longer; as the train approached the
capital, Maude smoothed her sunny-brown hair, adjusted
her laces, and bathed her pale face with <i>eau-de-cologne</i>.  Oh,
how grimy the process made her handkerchief after the dust
of her long and double journey!
</p>

<p>
The afternoon of the day was well advanced when
Maude, still paler, weary, unslept, and unrefreshed, faint
from want of food and the wear and tear of her own terrible
thoughts, arrived once more at the pretty villa Jack's
love had temporarily provided for her.
</p>

<p>
The blinds were all closed as if death were in its walls,
and her heart died within her.
</p>

<p>
She rushed up to her room; it might just be the case
that Jack might not have returned, and she might still
find the packet she had addressed to him and her incoherent
letter of farewell.
</p>

<p>
Is she in time?  Yes&mdash;a letter is there&mdash;a packet on her
toilet-table; she <i>is</i> in time&mdash;and makes a snatch of it.  It
is addressed not to her but to Hester Maule at Merlwood;
so Jack had been there and was gone, as were also his
portmanteaux, his sword, and helmet-case.
</p>

<p>
In wild and vague search she moved swiftly from room to
room.
</p>

<p>
'Jack&mdash;Jack!' she called in a low voice that sounded
strangely resonant in the silent rooms; but there was no
answer, nor did any sound evince that he was in her vicinity.
A chill crept over her, and she strove in vain to shake it off
as her wondering servants gathered round her, and from
them she soon learned all.
</p>

<p>
Their master had returned late last night&mdash;had got her
letter, and, after a time, had driven away to catch the first
early train for London&mdash;on his way to Egypt, he simply
said.  Egypt!  His train must have passed her somewhere
on the line.  Where was she to seek him&mdash;where telegraph
to him?  Who was to advise her now?
</p>

<p>
He had made up a packet of her letters, her rings, and
other little mementos she had left, with a brief and certainly
incoherent note to Hester Maule; addressed it with a
tremulous hand and carefully sealed it with his familiar
signet, bearing the baton or on a bend engrailed of the
Elliots of Braidielee; and then, throwing himself into a
cab, had driven away with no other trace than his farewell
words given to the startled domestics.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the humiliation of uselessly attempting to
explain matters to them, it was somewhat gratifying to
Maude to learn that after his return 'the poor master' had
been for a time quite quiet, as if stunned; then that he had
been like 'a tearing lunatic'; had telegraphed to Merlwood,
to Braidielee, and even to Earlshaugh for tidings of
her, but in vain; and in the latter instance, fully informing
Hawkey Sharpe that the train the latter had laid was ending
in an explosion; and then that 'the master' had set off by
daybreak.
</p>

<p>
He was not at his club in Queen Street.
</p>

<p>
Could he have taken London <i>en route</i> to Southampton, in
the wild, vague hope of tracing her?
</p>

<p>
Eventually she was made aware that he had written to his
own agents, and to Mr. M'Wadsett, to endeavour to elucidate
the mystery which hung over the actions of Maude, the
author of the forged letter, and to look after her during his
probably prolonged absence in Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Thus, in rage and bewilderment, grief and anxiety, had
Jack Elliot taken his departure, never doubting that they
were both the victims of some nefarious plot, which he had
not then time to unravel.
</p>

<p>
He was indignant, too, that Maude should so cruelly
mistake and doubt him.  He started for Egypt some twenty-four
hours sooner than he need have done, and hence came
fresh complications.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, what new and unexpected worry is this, Maude?'
exclaimed Hester Maule, when a few hours later the girl
threw herself speechless and in a passion of tears into her
arms.

<p>
And now, or eventually, three lives they were interested
in beyond all others (if Malcolm Skene survived), would be
involved in the terrible risks of the war in the Soudan.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIX.
<br /><br />
CHRISTMAS DAY IN CAMP AT KORTI.
</h3>

<p>
The last days of December saw Roland Lindsay with his
regiment&mdash;the 1st Battalion of the South Staffordshire&mdash;of
old, the 38th&mdash;a corps of the days of Queen Anne&mdash;the
corps of the gallant old Luke Lillingston, who led the troops
in Wilmot's West Indian Expedition of 1695&mdash;toiling in the
boats up the great river of Egypt against strong currents by
Kodokal, and within sight of the ruins of old Dongola&mdash;ruins
of red brick covering miles&mdash;by Debbeh, where the
currents were stronger still, and awnings could not be used,
though the heat was 120 degrees, and the men became
giddy and distracted by the white glare and the hot simmering
atmosphere, with lassitude and thirst, and where it was
so terrible at times, to emerge from the shadow of some
impending rock, once more to plod and pull the heavy oar
under the fierce and fiery sun.  Though occasionally spreading
the big sails like wings on each side of the boats, they
would have a pleasant hour's run in the evening ere darkness
or a rapid barred their upward way.
</p>

<p>
Then, on the redly-illuminated waters of the mighty and
mysterious river, the white sails of the squadron would show
up pleasantly in the twilight, after the landscape had been
ablaze with that rich profusion of colour only to be seen
where dark rocky hills, yellow desert sand, and patches of
verdant vegetation border, as they do on the upper reaches
of the Nile.
</p>

<p>
Then, when darkness came, the boats would close in with
the shore, where they were moored to a bank, and the sails
were lowered and stowed on board; while under the feathery
palms, or date trees, fires were lighted, the frugal ration of
bully-beef, onions, and potatoes was cooked and eaten amid
the jollity and lightness of heart which are ever a characteristic
of our soldiers, and then the poor fellows would coil
themselves up to sleep and prepare for the coming toil of the
morrow.
</p>

<p>
On the 22nd of December the camp at Korti was reached
at 9.30 in the evening, after a hard struggle amid a labyrinth
of sand banks.  Roland found the camp to be prettily
situated on the edge of the river, and surrounded by mimosa
trees, and there the advanced guard of the expedition,
detailed to relieve Gordon and raise the siege of the doomed
city, was now assembling fast.
</p>

<p>
It was a spot never trod by Britons before.  There the
caravans from Egypt to Sennar quit the Nile and proceed
across the Bayuda Desert, the route from Dongola being
easy for travelling, and the land on both banks of the river
rich and fertile.
</p>

<p>
At Korti, where now every hour or so our bugles were
blown, there stood in the days of Thothemus III. a great
temple dedicated to Isis, whose tears for the loss of Osiris
caused the regular inundations of the Nile.
</p>

<p>
Under some wide spreading trees the tents of the Camel
Corps were pitched along the western bank of the latter;
and the whole scene there was most picturesque.  The leafy
shade tempered the fierce heat of the sun, and, after their
long toil in the boats and over the burning sands and
glittering rocks, our soldiers were charmed for a time with the
place; but some wrath was excited when it was discovered
that a correspondence between a French journalist in the
camp of the Mahdi before Khartoum, and a clique in Cairo,
supplied the former with the fullest information of Lord
Wolseley's proceedings, with hints as to the best means of
baffling them.
</p>

<p>
Though the enemy were at some distance, every precaution
was taken against a surprise by night.  Cavalry vedettes
were posted out beyond the camp by day, and strong
outlying pickets, with chains of advanced sentries by night;
but, as Christmas Day drew near, considerable anxiety was
felt in the camp at Korti at the total cessation of all news
from blockaded Khartoum, which was two hundred and
sixty miles distant by the desert, and by river where the
former touched the latter at Gubat or Abu Kru.
</p>

<p>
The total strength of the advanced force at Korti, after
the departure of Roland's regiment, was under two thousand
five hundred men, with six screw guns, two thousand two
hundred camels and horses, two pinnaces, and sixty-four
whale boats, while the 19th Hussars, when the advance
began, had orders to ride by the western bank of the Nile
and act as scouts to the Khartoum relief column.
</p>

<p>
By this time there was not a single sound garment in the
latter&mdash;the result of fifty days' river work from Sarras.  The
mud-stained helmets were battered out of all shape; the
tunics and trousers were patched with cloth of every kind
and hue; officers and men had beards of many days'
growth, and the skin of their faces was peeled off in strange
and uncouth patches, the result of incessant exposure to the
fierce sun by day and the chill dews by night.
</p>

<p>
Christmas morning, 1884, was ushered in by a church
parade, and by prayer, when the whole force&mdash;slender
though it was&mdash;was present, under the feathery palms, by
the banks of the Nile, that river of mystery, which has its
rise in a land unknown; and at night the soldiers gathered
round two great camp-fires and made merry, singing
songs, and doubtless thinking of those who were far away at
home.
</p>

<p>
It was on this occasion that the South Staffordshire,
under the gallant Eyre, raised three hearty cheers, when,
from the rear, a telegram was brought, sent all the way from
their second battalion in England, wishing 'all ranks a happy
Christmas and a brilliant campaign.'
</p>

<p>
And happy and jolly all certainly were, though they were
now in the region of bully-beef, for they fared on hard
biscuits and coffee in the morning, with bully-beef for tiffin,
and bully-beef for dinner.
</p>

<p>
As the evening of Christmas Day closed in, Roland, with
a cigarette in his mouth, reclined on the grass under a
mimosa bush, watching the picturesque groups of tanned
and tattered soldiers that hovered round the two great
watch-fires, which cast weird patches of light on the feathery
palms, the glittering piles of arms, the few white tents
occupied by Lord Wolseley's staff and officers of rank; on
the long rows of picketed camels; on the distant figures of
the advanced sentinels seen darkly against the sky of pale
green and orange that showed where the sun had set beyond
Gebel Magaya in the Bayuda Desert; on the quaint boats
and barges moored in the Nile; and on the broad flow of
that majestic river, reddened as it was by the flames, to
which the active hands and sharp bill-hooks of the soldiers
added fuel every moment; while the high spirits of the
troops&mdash;seldom wont to flag&mdash;were irrepressible then in the
great hope of getting on&mdash;getting on and reaching Khartoum&mdash;to
shake hands with Gordon ere it might be&mdash;too late!
</p>

<p>
In three days the South Staffordshire were to start and
take the lead in that eventful expedition, and led by jovial
Dick Mostyn, Wilton, and other kindred spirits; already the
soldiers were chorusing a song with which they meant to
bend their oars; and more than once, as they sang, they
turned to where their favourite officer, Roland Lindsay, lay
looking on, for he was one of those men who are by nature
and habit born to be the leader of others, and possessing
that kind of magnetic influence which inspires confidence.
</p>

<p>
Roland had plenty of spirit, bodily vigour, and perseverance;
but when a halt came, and with it a brief term of
rest, he could not help indulging in occasional regretful
thoughts, haunting memories, and wishes that were hopeless.
He had, as Annot anticipated, got over his rudely-dispelled
passion for her, true love it could not have been, he flattered
himself now, and he was fully justified in dismissing <i>her</i>
from his mind; and in that matter he was disturbed by the
fact no more 'than a nightmare disturbs the occupations of
the dreamer, as he goes about his business on the following
day in the full light of heaven, and with his brain clear of
the idle fantasies of the darkness.'
</p>

<p>
But now he could not help thinking of Hester Maule,
especially as he had seen her last, when she stood at the
door of Merlwood, and murmured good-bye, her hand in
his, her dark blue eyes dimmed with gathering tears&mdash;the
tears that he knew would fall when he was gone&mdash;her graceful
head drooping towards him, and how he now, as then,
longed to whisper in her little white ear the words he scarcely
knew how to utter, and which were withheld through very
shame of himself.
</p>

<p>
Earlshaugh he deemed, of course, now gone from his
family for ever; well, it was only one more case of the now
daily sinking out of sight, the decay or destruction of good
old Scottish families, while mushrooms came up to take their
place in the land, though seldom in history.
</p>

<p>
Roland had and still loved Hester, and in his heart
believed in her as an embodiment of all that is good and
pure in womanhood; but rather unwisely had allowed the
fact to be guessed at by her, thinking that she understood
him, and that his declaration might be made at any time;
and, as we have shown, he was quite upon the point thereof,
when Annot Drummond came with her wiles and smiles to
prove the evil genius of them both.
</p>

<p>
In connection with Annot's name he almost let his scornful
lips form a malediction now&mdash;that name once linked
with the dearest and fondest terms his fancy could frame.
Yet he could not even now class all women under her
category, and believe that beauty was given them for the
sole purpose of winning men's hearts without losing their
own.  But his reflections at times on his own folly were
fiery and bitter for all that; and as a sedative he enjoyed
to the utmost extent the daily excitement of active service
now in that remarkable land, the Soudan.
</p>

<p>
Christmas-night in the camp at Korti was indeed a merry
one, and although under the eyes of Lord Wolseley and his
staff, the soldiers were in no way repressed in their jollity
and fun&mdash;for a little of the latter goes a long way in the
army&mdash;and, all unlike the Northern Yule to which they were
accustomed, it was without snow or icicles, holly-berries,
mistletoe, and plum-pudding; but those who lingered round
these watch-fires on the arid sand of the Soudan had many
a kindly and tender thought of the bright family circles, the
loved faces, and household scenes of those who were dear
to them, and were so far, far away beyond the drear Bayuda
Desert, and beyond the seas, in many a pretty English
village, where the Christmas carols were being sung while
the chimes rang joyously in the old ivied steeple, in memory
of the star that shone over Bethlehem&mdash;the herald of peace
and goodwill to men.
</p>

<p>
Ere that festival came again more than one battle had to
be fought&mdash;Khartoum would be lost or won&mdash;Gordon saved
or abandoned and betrayed&mdash;and many a young heart that
was full of joy and hope would be as cold as inexorable
death could make it; but no thought of these things marred
the merry night our soldiers spent as they turned into the
bivouac at Korti&mdash;for though called a camp, it was scarcely
a complete one.
</p>

<p>
Dick Mostyn had procured some wine from an enterprising
Greek sutler; and this he shared freely with Lindsay
and others while it lasted.
</p>

<p>
Though poor, and such as was never seen on the mess-table,
it was voted 'capital stuff,' in that part of the world,
and Dick&mdash;with a sigh&mdash;wished his 'throat was a mile long,'
as he drained the last of it.
</p>

<p>
'Such a wonderful flow of spirits you always have, Dick!'
said Lindsay.
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;I have made up my mind to be jolly, remembering
Mark Tapley and his Eden,' replied Mostyn.
</p>

<p>
'Jolly on your couch&mdash;the sand?'
</p>

<p>
'Jolly as a sandboy&mdash;yes; yet not disinclined to pray for
the man who invented a good feather-bed, even as Sancho
Panza did for him who invented sleep.'
</p>

<p>
Indeed, Mostyn admitted that he was happier in the
Soudan than he had been in England.
</p>

<p>
He had fluttered the dovecots of the West End with
tolerable success, and might have 'bagged an heiress,' as
he phrased it; but high stakes at his club, bets on every
possible thing; a bad book on the Derby, ditto on the
Oaks; unpaid accounts&mdash;St. John's Wood and 'going to
the devil on all fours,' marred his chances; then his gouty
old governor had come down upon him with his
'cut-you-off-with-a-shilling face;' and Dick
thought he was well out of
all his troubles, and had <i>only</i> the Arabs to face in the Soudan.
</p>

<p>
Next day the regiment was inspected and highly
complimented by Lord Wolseley, as 'the first to come up with
the boats,' adding, 'I know you will do credit to the county
you are named after and to the character you have won.  I
am proud to have such a battalion on service with me.'
</p>

<p>
This ceremony was scarcely over and the soldiers' dinner
drum been beaten as a summons once more to bully-beef
and hard biscuits, when a few boats brought up a
detachment that marched at once into camp, where crowds
gathered round them, as newcomers, to hear the last news
from the rear, as letters were becoming scarce and
newspapers just then still more so.
</p>

<p>
A tall officer who was in command, with his canvas
haversack, water-bottle, revolver-case, and jack-knife dangling
about him, and whose new fighting suit of gray contrasted
with the tattered attire of Roland and others, came towards
them with impatient strides.

<h3>
CHAPTER L.
<br /><br />
THE START FOR KHARTOUM.
</h3>

<p>
'Elliot, can this be Jack Elliot?' exclaimed Dick Mostyn
as he screwed an eyeglass into his left eye.  'By Jove, he
looks as if he had a bad toothache!  What's up, Jack&mdash;lost
your heart to some fair Cairene on the Shoubrah road&mdash;eh?'
</p>

<p>
'Jack Elliot it is!' said Roland, as the officer in question,
after 'handing over' his detachment, made his way to the
quarters of the South Staffordshire, 'you are just in time to
go up the river with us.  We are on the eve of starting for
Khartoum.'
</p>

<p>
'At last!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, at last,' continued Roland, as they grasped each
other's hands, and the latter, when looking intently into his
brother-in-law's face, detected a grave, grim, keen-eyed,
harassed, and even haggard expression, which was all unlike
the jovial, free, and open one he was wont to see there.
'Why, Jack,' said he, 'what the devil is up?  Are you ill
with fever, or what?  Did you leave all well at home?' he
added as he drew him aside.
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;yes&mdash;I suppose; but ill or well, thereby hangs a
tale&mdash;a devil of a tale; but ere I can tell it, give me
something to drink, old fellow&mdash;my water-bottle is empty&mdash;flask
ditto, and then I shall relate that which you would rather
not hear.'
</p>

<p>
Jack unbuckled and flung his sword aside, while Roland
hastily and impatiently supplied his wants, and then heard
his brief, rapid, and startling story, winding up with the
disappearance of Maude from the villa, and the incoherent and
mysterious letter of farewell she left for him.
</p>

<p>
'After this&mdash;the deluge!' exclaimed Roland in the direst
perplexity.
</p>

<p>
'God and my own heart only know what it cost me to
start for the seat of war, leaving Maude, as I did, untraced,
unfollowed, and undiscovered; but I had neither time nor
an address to follow up,' sighed Elliot; 'and God only
knows, too, how all this has cut her as it must have cut
her&mdash;my poor darling&mdash;to the soul!'
</p>

<p>
The meeting of Roland and Jack Elliot was one of
perplexity, gloom, and genuine distress.  Far away from the
land where they could be of help or use in unravelling the
mystery, or succouring Maude, whom they deemed then a
houseless fugitive, they felt themselves miserably powerless,
hopeless, and exasperated; but curiously, perhaps, they
never thought of suspecting the real author of the mischief,
and were utterly at a loss to conceive how such a complication
and accusation came about in any way.
</p>

<p>
Neither Jack nor Roland could know or conceive that
she was safe under her uncle's wing at Merlwood.  Thus
they had to endure the anxiety of supposing her, with all
her beauty, refinement, and delicacy, to be adrift in some
homeless, aimless, and despairing way in London&mdash;haunted
by anger and terror of an injury and irreparable wrong.
The contemplation of this state of affairs filled the minds of
both with incessant torture&mdash;a torture for which there was
no relief, and would be none, either by letter or telegraph,
for a long time, if ever, to them, as inexorably&mdash;in two days
now&mdash;the regiment would be again on the Nile.
</p>

<p>
'Reason how we may,' was the ever-recurring and gloomy
thought of Roland now, 'it has been said that Fate does
certainly pursue some families to their ruin and extinction,
and such is our probable end&mdash;the Lindsays of Earlshaugh!'
</p>

<p>
And so, apart from their brother officers, these two
conversed and talked of the mysterious episode of the woman
and her claims again and again, viewing it in every imaginable
way, till they almost grew weary of it, in the hopelessness
of elucidating it while in the Soudan; and as for
poor Malcolm Skene and <i>his</i> fate, that was supposed to
be a thing of the past, and they ceased to surmise about it.
</p>

<p>
At 2 p.m. on the 28th of December the start for Khartoum began!
</p>

<p>
It was made by the South Staffordshire, under the gallant
Eyre, with exactly 19 officers and 527 men of the Regiment,
and 2 officers and 20 men of the Royal Engineers in 50
boats, having the Staffordshire Knot painted on their bows,
the badge of the old '38th.'
</p>

<p>
The sight was a fine and impressive one; the band was
playing merrily in the leading boat, as usual, Scottish and
Irish airs, as England, apparently, has none for any martial
purpose.  Thus it is that Scottish and Irish quicksteps are
now ordered by the Horse Guards for nearly all the English
regiments, with Highland reels for the Cavalry, and one
other air in the 'Queen's Regulations,' with which we bid
farewell to the old colours, is 'Auld Lang Syne.'
</p>

<p>
Steadily the whole battalion moved up stream, cheering
joyously&mdash;the first away for Khartoum&mdash;exhibiting a regularity
and power of stroke as they feathered their oars, and
showing how much recent practice had done to convert
them into able boatmen, and soon the camp was left
behind, and the boats had the bare desert on both sides of
the stream; but on and on they went, stemming the current
of the famous Nile, famous even in the remotest ages,
when the Egyptians worshipped the cow, the cat, the ibis,
and the crocodile, and when King Amenchat, sixth of the
Twelfth Dynasty, cut his huge river-like canal to join Lake
M[oe]ris, 250 miles lower down.
</p>

<p>
On the 29th the Staffordshire boats were off the island
of Massawi, where the atmosphere was grilling, being 120
degrees in the shade; but the soldiers were in the highest
spirits, their regiment being the leading one of the whole
army.
</p>

<p>
One scorching day followed another, yet on and on they
toiled unwearyingly, passing Merawi and Abu Dom amid
date-trees and rank, gigantic tropical vegetation, till the
New Year's Day of 1885 found them nearing the foot of
a cataract, after passing which the River Column was to
form for its final advance on Khartoum.  Already the
uniforms were more than ever ragged, and scarcely a man
had boots to his feet.
</p>

<p>
Roland and Elliot had command of different boats, so
they could commune no more, even when they moored for
the night by the river's bank, when the crimson sun had set
in ruddy splendour beyond the gray hills of the Bayuda
Desert, and the dingy yellow of the Nile was touched by
the afterglow, in which its waves rippled in purple and silver
sheen, while the dark, feathery palms and fronds swayed
slowly to and fro in the friendly breeze, and the great
pelicans were seen to wade amid the slime and ooze where
the hideous crocodiles were dozing.
</p>

<p>
In some places the boats were rowed between islets which
displayed a wondrous tropical wealth of dhurra, sugar-canes,
and cotton-trees, with palms innumerable.
</p>

<p>
Officers and men&mdash;even chaplains&mdash;worked hard at the
oars in their anxiety to get on.  For days some never had
the oar out of their hands; on others they were hauling the
boats over the rapids and up cataracts, where at times they
stuck in rocks and sandbanks, and had to be unloaded and
lifted bodily off.  At times the pulling was awful, and the
hot sun scorched the back like fire, while the boats seemed
to stand still in places where the main stream forced itself
between masses of rock in a downward torrent, forming
ugly whirlpools, about which the only certainty was, that
whoever fell into them was drowned.
</p>

<p>
'Pull for your lives,' was then the cry; 'give way,
men&mdash;give way with a will!  Pull, or you'll be down the
rapids.'
</p>

<p>
Then might be seen the men with their helmets off,
bare-headed, and braving sunstroke under that merciless
sunshine; steaming with perspiration&mdash;their teeth set hard&mdash;their
hearts panting with the awful and, at times, apparently
hopeless exertion of pulling against that mighty barrier of
downward rolling water against which they seemed to make
no head; yet ever and anon the cry went up:
</p>

<p>
'Pull, my lads, cheerily&mdash;we'll shake hands with old
Gordon yet!'
</p>

<p>
And so they toiled on&mdash;now up to their knees in mud,
now up to their chins in water, in rags and tatters, their
blistered and festered hands swathed in dirty linen bandages,
officers and men alike; often hungry, ever thirsty and weary,
yet strong in heart and high in impulse, as our soldiers ever
are when face to face with difficulty or death.
</p>

<p>
Then a little breeze might catch the sails, carry the boats
ahead, and then a cheer of satisfaction would make the
welkin ring.
</p>

<p>
Incredible was the amount of skill, care, and toil requisite
for getting the boats of the flotilla up the Nile, especially at
these places where with terrible force the rapids came in one
sheet of foam, with a ceaseless roar between narrow walls of
black rock at a visible incline, while at times the yells of
thousands of wondering natives on the banks lent a strange
and thrilling interest to the scene.
</p>

<p>
'At low Nile,' says a writer, 'these rapids are wild and
desolate archipelagos, usually at least one or two miles in
length, while the river bank on either side presents a series
of broken, precipitous, and often inaccessible cliffs and
rugged spurs.  Their sombre and gloomy appearance is
heightened by the colour of the rock, which, between high
and low water-mark, is usually of a jet hue, and in many
places so polished by the long action of the water, that it
has the appearance of being carefully black-leaded.  One or
two big-winged, dusky birds may suddenly flap across, with
a harsh, uncanny cry, or some small boy, whose tailor's bills
must trouble him little, looks up from his fish-trap and
shrieks for backsheesh; but beyond these, and the ceaseless
rush of the water, sound or sight there is none.'
</p>

<p>
Many of these islets are submerged at high Nile, creating
a number of cross currents which vary with the depth of
the water, and render navigation difficult to all, and
impossible to those who are unacquainted with each special
locality; thus the troops of the relieving column had before
them such a task as even Britons scarcely ever encountered
before; but the Canadians, under Colonel Kennedy, of the
Ontario Militia; the Indians, under the great chief White
Eagle, and the soldiers, all worked splendidly together.
</p>

<p>
The 3rd of January saw the Staffordshire reach the
Bivouac of Handab, in a wild and rocky spot, and in a
position of peril between two great bodies of the enemy;
but cheerily the soldiers joined in the queer chorus of a
doggerel Canadian boat song adapted to the occasion by
the Indians, who, whilom, had made the poplar groves of
the Red River and Lake Winnipeg echo to it&mdash;

CHAPTER LI.
<br /><br />
THE MARCH IN THE DESERT.
</h3>

<p>
We have stated that Roland and his comrades were left
stationed at a point where they were menaced by two
forces of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
'These were,' says Colonel Eyre, of the Staffordshire, in
his 'Diary,' 'the tribes whose people murdered poor Colonel
Stewart.  They are entrenched twenty-three miles in front
of us up the river, and sent word that they were to fight.
They have a large force on the Berber Road, forty miles on
our flank; they were here two days ago, and took all the
camels in the district.  We are encamped on a wild desert,
with ridges of rocky hills about two miles inland.  We have
pitched our tents.'
</p>

<p>
There we shall leave them for a time, and look back to
Korti, where some boats of troops arrived from Hannek,
twenty-three miles lower down the Nile, and in one of
these, tugging manfully at an oar, came the rescued
Malcolm Skene!
</p>

<p>
His disappearance many weeks before&mdash;nearly three
months now&mdash;was well known to the troops; hence&mdash;though
in that fierce warfare, a human life, more or less lost or
saved, mattered little&mdash;his sudden appearance in camp,
when he reported himself at the headquarter tent, did make
a little stir for a time; and thus he was the hero of the
hour; but great and forward movements were in progress
now, and there was not much time to waste on anyone or
anything else.
</p>

<p>
Though he had missed his corps, the Staffordshire, by
about twenty-four hours, it was with a source of intense
satisfaction that he found himself among his own countrymen
again&mdash;once more with the troops and ready for active
service of any kind.
</p>

<p>
One thought was fully prominent in his mind, never again
would he be taken alive by the Soudanese.
</p>

<p>
A horse, harness, and arms, belonging to some of the
killed or drowned, were speedily provided for him, and, by
order of the General commanding, he was attached to the
personal staff&mdash;<i>pro tem.</i>&mdash;of Sir Herbert Stewart, as his
great knowledge of the country and of Arabic might prove
of good service.
</p>

<p>
Considering the treachery of Hassan Abdullah, his long
detention in the zereba of the Sheikh Moussa, and what his
too probable end would have been after the deportation of
Zebehr Pasha, with the recent close and deadly struggle he
had for life in the grasp of Girolamo, and how nearly he
escaped recapture and slaughter, Malcolm Skene had now
a personal and somewhat rancorous animosity to the
Soudanese.
</p>

<p>
Now that he had not perished in the desert, in the river,
by Arab hands, or in any fashion as his troublesome
presentiment had led him to expect when he left Cairo guided
by that rascal Hassan on his lonely mission to Dayr-el-Syrian,
he felt a curious sense of mortification, compunction,
almost of regret, concerning the very tender and loving
letter of farewell he had written to Hester Maule; and
began to think it would be somewhat remarkable and awkward
if&mdash;after all&mdash;he should again meet her face to face in
society.
</p>

<p>
Then again, as often before, he seemed to see in fancy
the conservatory at Earlshaugh, with its long and faintly lit
vistas of flowers, rare exotics, with feathery acacias and
orange trees and azaleas overhead; the gleam of the moonshine
on the adjacent lakelet; the tall slender figure and
soft dark eyes of Hester; and to his vivid imagination her
words and his own came back to him, with the nervous
expression of her sad and parted lips as she forbade him
ever to hope, and yet gave him no reason why!
</p>

<p>
How long, long ago, it seemed since then!  Yet he often
fancied himself saying to her:
</p>

<p>
'Is the answer you gave me then still the same, dear
Hester?'
</p>

<p>
Well&mdash;well&mdash;that was over and done with, as yet, and ere
dawn came in on the 29th of December he was roused by
the bugles sounding 'the assembly' for the advance.
</p>

<p>
Lord Wolseley's orders were now that General Earle,
with an Infantry Brigade (including the Black Watch and
Staffordshire), was to punish the Monassir tribe for the
murder of Colonel Donald Stewart; while the Mounted
Infantry and Guards Camel Corps, under Sir Herbert
Stewart, were to advance on a march of exploration to
Gakdul, a distance of ninety miles, with a convoy of camels
laden with stores&mdash;a route between the deserts of Bayuda
and Ababdeh.
</p>

<p>
A little after 3 a.m. on the 29th of December, the cavalry
scouts, under Major Kitchener, with some Arab guides,
moved off, and then Lord Wolseley gave his orders for the
column to get into motion, and strike straight off across the
pebble-strewn desert, towards the distant horizon, which
was indicated only by a dark, opaque, and undulating line,
against which a mimosa tuft stood up, and above which the
rays of the yet unrisen sun were faintly crimsoning the then
hazy sky, which otherwise as yet was totally dark.
</p>

<p>
To Sir Herbert Stewart the final orders were brought by
Malcolm Skene, his new aide-de-camp.
</p>

<p>
'You are to advance, sir, in column of companies, with
an interval of thirty paces between each, the Guards Camel
Corps and Engineers in front, the convoy and baggage next,
then the Artillery and Mounted Infantry, the Hussars to
form the advance and rear guards.'
</p>

<p>
Malcolm saluted, reined back his horse, and betook him
to the inevitable cigarette, while the camels ceased to grunt,
and stalked off to the posts assigned them, and the column
began to move, so as to be in readiness to form a hollow
square at a moment's notice.
</p>

<p>
To Malcolm Skene, even to him who had recently seen
so much, it was indeed a strange sight to watch the
departing camels, with their long, slender necks stretched out
like those of ostriches, and their legs, four thousand pairs
in number, gliding along in military order, silently, softly,
noiselessly, like a mighty column of phantoms, beast and
rider, until the light, rising dust of the desert blended all,
soldiers, camels, convoy, artillery, and baggage, into one
gray, uniform mass, which ere long seemed to fade out, to
pass away from the eyes of those who remained behind in
the camp.
</p>

<p>
In case of an attack the Guards were to form square,
echeloned on the left front of the column; the Mounted
Infantry were to do the same on the right rear; but the
column was so great in length that it was feared their fire
would scarcely protect the entire line unless the usually
swift enemy were seen approaching in time to get the
baggage and convoy closed up; for, broad though the front
of this strange column, it was fully a mile long, and would
have proved very unwieldy to handle in case of a sudden
onslaught.  Thus on the march it frequently halted,
dismounted, and, for practice, prepared to meet the enemy,
and was so formed that if the latter got among the camels
they would be exposed to an enfilading fire from two faces
each way.
</p>

<p>
After a halt nine miles distant from Korti, and as many
to the left of the Wady Makattem, the march was resumed
under a peculiarly brilliant moonlight&mdash;one so bright that
few present had ever seen anything like it before.
</p>

<p>
Not a cloud was visible in the far expanse of the firmament;
there were millions upon millions of stars sparkling, but
their brightness paled almost out in the brilliance of
the moon.  There were no leaves to shine in the dew, but
showers of diamonds seemed to gem the yellow pebbles of
the desert; and had birds been there, they might have sung
as if a new day had dawned; yet how all unlike the warm
glow of an Egyptian day was the icy splendour of the
moonlight that mingled in one quarter with the coming redness
of the east.
</p>

<p>
Every sword-blade, every rifle-barrel, every buckle and
stirrup-iron, glinted out in light, while the figures of every
camel and horse, soldier, and artillery-wheel were clearly
defined as at noonday; and no sound broke the stillness
save the shrill voices of the Somali camel-drivers.
</p>

<p>
It was soon after this that Major Barrow, when scouting
with some Hussars, came upon a solitary messenger, bearer
of a tiny scrap of paper, no larger than a postage stamp&mdash;one
of the last missives from Gordon, dated 14th December,
he being then shut up in Khartoum.
</p>

<p>
The moonlight faded; the red dawn came in, and still
the march of the column went on; in front a dreary, sandy,
and waterless desert; behind, the narrow streak of green
that indicated the course of the Nile; and now our officers
began to say to each other that 'if the camel corps alone
was from the first deemed sufficient to relieve Khartoum,
then why, at such enormous expense, exertion, and toil,
were 3,000 infantry brought blundering up the Nile?  And
anon, if they were not sufficient, surely there was infinite
danger in exposing the corps, unsupported, to the contingency
of an overwhelming attack by the united forces of the
Mahdi.'
</p>

<p>
It was found that there were wells, however, at Hamboka,
El Howeiyat, and elsewhere, far apart, and that so far as
water was concerned the practicability of the desert route to
Metemneh was proved by the march to Gakdul; after
reaching which Sir Herbert Stewart retraced his steps to
Korti; where two days afterwards, about noon, a cloud of
dust seen rising in the distance, almost to the welkin,
announced the return of his column, looming large and
darkly out of the mirage of the desert, in forms that were
strange, distorted, and gigantic, after leaving twenty
broken-down camels to die, abandoned in the awful waste.
</p>

<p>
Just as Stewart came, the sound of Scottish pipes on the
Nile announced the arrival of the Black Watch in their
boats off Korti.  All round the world have our bagpipes
sounded, but never before so far into the heart of the Dark
Continent.
</p>

<p>
On Thursday, the 8th of January, the second advance
through the desert began, and the natives looked upon the
troops as doomed men.  Three armies, larger and better
equipped, had departed on the same errand to 'smash up'
the Mahdi, but had been cut off nearly to a man, and their
unburied skeletons were strewn all over the country.
</p>

<p>
All the officers in Sir Herbert Stewart's column were
strangers to Malcolm Skene, but such is the influence of
service together, <i>camaraderie</i> and companionship in danger
and suffering, that even in these days of general muddle and
'scratch' formations, he felt already quite like an old friend
with the staff and many others.
</p>

<p>
The pebble-strewn desert was glistening in the moonlight,
when the column <i>en route</i> for Khartoum, <i>viâ</i> Gubat and
Metemneh, marched off at two in the morning, and ever
and anon the bugle rang out on the ambient air, sounding
'halt,' that the stragglers in the rear might close up, and
then the long array continued to glide like a phantom army,
or a mass of moving shadows, across the waste.
</p>

<p>
Three hours afterwards, there stole upon one quarter of
the horizon a lurid gleam&mdash;the herald of the coming day;
then the bugles struck up a Scottish quick-step&mdash;the silence
was broken, and the men began to talk cheerily, and 'chaff'
each other, though already enduring that parched sensation
in the mouth, peculiar to all who traverse the deserts that
border on the Nile&mdash;a parched feeling for which liquor,
curious to say, is almost useless, and often increases the
torture&mdash;and all, particularly the marching infantry, in
defiance of orders, drank from their water-bottles
surreptitiously, even when it was announced that seventy more
miles had to be covered ere a proper supply could be
obtained from wells.
</p>

<p>
Those at Hamboka, forty-seven miles from Korti, were
found full of dry sand&mdash;destroyed by the horsemen of the
Sheikh Moussa Abu Hagil, who was in that quarter; those
at El Howieyat, eight miles further on, were in nearly the
same condition, and already the soldiers were becoming
maddened by thirst.
</p>

<p>
Day had passed, and again the weary march was resumed
in the dark.
</p>

<p>
At the well of Abu Haifa, eighty miles from Korti, the
scene that ensued was exciting and painful&mdash;even terrible.
The orders were that the fighting men were to be first
supplied; and, held back by the bayonet's point, the
wretched camp-followers, Somali camel-drivers, and others
frantically tore up the warm sand with their hands in the
hope that a little water might collect therein, and when it
did so, they stooped and lapped it up like thirsty cats or
dogs.  Others failed to achieve this, and with their mouths
cracked, their entrails shrivelled, their flashing eyes wild and
hollow, they rolled about with frenzy at their hearts, and
blasphemy on their lips.  There was no reasoning with
them&mdash;they could no longer reason.
</p>

<p>
Even the resolute British soldier could scarcely be
restrained by habitual discipline from throwing the latter
aside, and joining in the throng that surged around the
so-called well&mdash;a mere stony hole in the desert sand&mdash;while
in the background were maddened horses, and even the
ever-patient camels, plunging, struggling, unmanageable, and
fighting desperately with their masters for a drop of that
precious liquid.
</p>

<p>
In the struggle here Malcolm Skene, as an officer, got his
water-bottle filled among the earliest, having ridden forward,
and with a sigh that was somewhat of a prayer he was
about to take a deep draught therefrom, when the wan face,
the haggard eyes, and parched lips of a young soldier of the
2nd Sussex caught his eye.  Too weak to struggle, perhaps
too well-bred, if breeding could be remembered in that
hour of madness, or so despairing as to be careless, he had
made no effort to procure water, or if he did so, had
failed.
</p>

<p>
Skene's heart smote him.
</p>

<p>
'Drink, my man,' said he, proffering his water-bottle,
'and then I shall.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, may God bless you, sir,' murmured the poor
infantry lad fervently, as he drank, and returned the bottle
with a salute.
</p>

<p>
Gakdul&mdash;hemmed in by lofty and stupendous precipices
of bare rock&mdash;was reached on the 12th January, when, amid
cheers and rejoicings, a plentiful supply of water was
obtained, after which preparations were made for the march
to Metemneh, where it was known that thousands were
gathering to bar our way to Khartoum.  Yet Stewart's total
strength was only 1,607 men of all ranks, encumbered by
304 camp followers, and 2,380 camels and horses.  The
halt of two days at Gakdul did wonders in restoring the
energies of men and cattle.
</p>

<p>
There Malcolm Skene's knowledge of Arabic was frequently
in requisition.  As yet the leaders of this advanced
column were utterly without any trustworthy intelligence as
to the movements of the Mahdi's army, for bands of prowling
robbers and the Bedouins of the Sheikh Moussa infested
every route in front and rear, keeping carefully out of sight
by day-time, but swooping down on the camping grounds by
night in the hope of finding abandoned spoil&mdash;perhaps sick
or wounded men to torture and slay.
</p>

<p>
Sir Herbert Stewart arrived on the 16th of January within
a few miles of the now famous wells of Abu Klea, after a
waterless march of forty-three miles from those of El Faar,
and already even the poor camels had become so reduced
in physique that as many as thirty dropped down to die in
one day; but the troops reached a line of black sandstone
ridges lying westward of Abu Klea, and a squadron of
Hussars, whose horses were suffering most severely from
want of water, cantered forward to inspect the country, and
Malcolm Skene rode with them.
</p>

<p>
At mid-day they found the enemy in a valley, where long
and reedy grass was waving in the hot breeze&mdash;a place
studded by several camel-thorns and acacias.  The Arab
centre occupied a long and gentle slope, like the glacis of an
earthwork.
</p>

<p>
Led by a Sheikh, about 200 mounted men advanced
resolutely and in tolerable order, opening fire with their
Remingtons on the Hussars.
</p>

<p>
In their leader, Malcolm, through his field-glass, recognised
the Sheikh Moussa Abu Hagil, who alone of all his band
wore a suit of that mail armour of the Middle Ages, which
is thus described by Colonel Colborne, who says 'it was in
the Soudan' he first saw it, to his amazement: 'Whether
original or a copy of it, it was undoubtedly the dress of the
Crusaders.  The hauberk was fastened round the body by
the belt, and formed a complete covering from head to foot.
The long and double-edged sword was worn between the leg
and saddle.'
</p>

<p>
Moussa wore a flat-topped helmet with a plume, and
tippet of Darfour mail; his horse's head was cased in steel,
and covered by a quilt thick enough to turn a spear; but,
save their bodies, which were clad in Mahdi shirts, his
followers were naked&mdash;with their dark, bronze-like legs and
arms bare.
</p>

<p>
Under their fire the reconnoitring force of Hussars fell
back, an operation viewed by Sir Herbert Stewart and his
staff from the summit of a lofty hill composed entirely of
black and shining rock, from whence he could see the whole
country for miles, and from where he ordered a general
advance.
</p>

<p>
By difficult defiles, and in serious distress owing to the
want of water, the troops advanced in steady and splendid
order, the line being led by the Brigade Major, David, Earl
of Airlie, of the 10th Hussars&mdash;one of a grand old historic
race&mdash;round whose Castle of Cortachy a spectre drummer is
said to beat when fate is nigh&mdash;and he had brought the
whole into the valley by half-past two o'clock; then Sir
Herbert, having ascertained from Skene's report that the
wells of Abu Klea were too far in rear of the Arab position
to be accessible that night, resolved to fortify the ground
he occupied, a ridge rising gently from the Wady, but
broken before it reached the hills, while close in rear of
it was a grassy hollow, wherein the baggage animals were
picketed.
</p>

<p>
Hasty parapets of stones, gathered from the ground
whereon the troops lay, were constructed along the front of
the position, flanked by <i>abattis</i> of thorny mimosa, while the
great hill of black rock referred to was occupied by a party
of signallers, who built thereon a redoubt; while a mile in
its rear, on the brow of a precipice, another fortlet was
formed as a rallying point in case of a reverse.
</p>

<p>
With his staff and a few Hussars Sir Herbert now rode to
the front, and saw, as the ruddy sun began to set and cast
long shadows over the swelling uplands of the scenery, the
enemy in their thousands taking possession of a lofty hill
sixteen hundred paces distant on his right&mdash;a position from
whence they could completely enfilade his lines.  Thus
ere darkness fell they secured the range, and from that time
no one could reckon on twenty minutes' sound sleep.
</p>

<p>
Prior to that a couple of shells were thrown among them,
exploding with brilliant glares and loud crashes, on which
they retired a little or sank down, leaving two great white
banners floating out against the starry sky-line.
</p>

<p>
All night long they 'potted' away with their Remingtons,
keeping up a desultory, but most harassing, fire, their long
range and trajectory placing every point in danger, and some
of their bullets fell whizzing downwards through the air upon
the sleepers.
</p>

<p>
Many men were wounded, and many camels, too, and all
night long, while their rifle shots flashed redly out of the
darkness, they maintained a horrible din on their one-headed
war drums, making the hours hideous.
</p>

<p>
All through the dark and moonless night these savage
sounds rose and swelled upon the dewy air, and formed a
fitting accompaniment to the wail of their pestering bullets
as they swept over the silent British bivouac.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LII.
<br /><br />
THE PRESENTIMENT FULFILLED.
</h3>

<p>
So passed the night.
</p>

<p>
On the morning of the 17th of January, early, and without
blast of bugle or beat of drum, a frugal breakfast&mdash;the
last meal that many were to have in this world&mdash;was served
round, and had been barely partaken of, when the Arab
skirmishers came swarming over the low hills on our right
flank, and opened fire with their Remingtons at eleven
hundred yards' range.
</p>

<p>
With a succession of dreadful crashes, our shrapnel shell
exploded among them, tearing many to pieces and putting
the rest to flight; and after more than one attempt to lure
the enemy from their position had failed, at 7 a.m. Sir
Herbert Stewart began his preparations to advance, and
drive them from the wells of Abu Klea.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the army of the Mahdi had been continually
appearing and disappearing in front, their many-coloured
pennons streaming out on the passing breeze, their long
sword-blades and spear-heads flashing brightly in the red
rays of the uprising sun, while the thunder of their
battle-drums and their savage wild cries loaded the morning
air.
</p>

<p>
Five ranks deep, four thousand of them deployed in
irregular lines along a hollow in our front, led by mounted
sheikhs and dervishes, clad in richly-embroidered Mahdi
camises, and posted at intervals of twenty-five yards
apart&mdash;conspicuous among them Moussa Abu Hagil, in his
Darfour shirt of mail.
</p>

<p>
They were posted on strong ground westward of the
wells, which our soldiers, sorely athirst, were full of anxiety
to reach; and as the camels were mostly to be left in the
rear, they were knee-haltered, and their stores and saddles
used to strengthen the parapets of the detached fortlets.
</p>

<p>
In the fighting square which now advanced were only
one hundred camels for carrying litters, stores, water, and
spare ammunition.
</p>

<p>
The Heavies on this eventful morning were led by
Colonel Talbot; the Guards by Colonel Boscawen; the
gallant Barrow led the Mounted Infantry, and Lord
Beresford the slender Naval Brigade.
</p>

<p>
Men were being knocked over now on every hand, and
among the first who fell was Lord St. Vincent, of the
17th Lancers, who received a wound that proved mortal.
Under Barrow the Mounted Infantry went darting forward,
and the Arab skirmishers fell back before them, vanishing
into the long wavy grass from amid which the smoke of
their rifles spirted up.  Skene had the spike of his helmet
carried away by one ball; his bridle hand sharply grazed by
another, but he bound his handkerchief about the wound
and rode on.
</p>

<p>
By this time nearly an hour had elapsed since the zereba
and its fortlets had been left in the rear, and only two miles
of ground had been covered, and all the while our troops
had been under a fire from the sable warriors on the hill
slopes.
</p>

<p>
'Halt!' was now sounded by the bugles, and the faces
of the square were redressed and post was to be taken on a
slope, which the enemy would have to ascend when attacking.
</p>

<p>
Their total strength was now estimated at 14,000 men!
</p>

<p>
Our dead men were left where they fell; but frequent
were the halts for picking up the wounded.  Yet steady as
if on parade in a home barrack square, our little band
advanced, over stony crests, through dry water-courses, like
some hugh machine, compact and slow, firm and regular,
amid the storm of bullets poured into it from the front, from
the flanks, and eventually from the rear.
</p>

<p>
At first the enemy swarmed in dark masses all along our
front, and for two or three miles on either flank groups of
their horsemen, with floating garments and glittering spears,
could be seen watching the advance of the hollow square
from black peaks of splintered rock.  'There was no
avenue of retreat now for us,' wrote one, 'and no one
thought of such a thing.  "Let us do or die!" (in the
words of Bruce's war song) was the emotion of all; and
Colonel Barrow, C.B., with his "handful" of Hussars,
became engaged about the same time as the square.'
</p>

<p>
He maintained a carbine fire, while General Stewart, with
his personal staff, including Major Wardrop, the Earl of
Airlie, and Captains Skene and Rhodes, galloped from point
to point, keeping all in readiness to repulse a sudden
charge; but, with all their bravery, it was a trial for our
Heavy Dragoons to march on foot and fight with infantry
rifles and bayonets&mdash;weapons to which they were totally
unaccustomed.
</p>

<p>
The keen, yet dreamy sense of imminent peril&mdash;the
chances of sudden death, with the spasmodic tightness of
the chest that emotion sometimes causes, had passed from
Malcolm Skene now completely; he 'felt cool as a cucumber,'
yet instinct with the fierce desire to close with, to grapple,
and to spur among the enemy <i>sabre à la main</i>; and he
forgot even the smarting of his wounded bridle hand as the
troops moved onward.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes after ten o'clock, when the leading face of
the square had won the crest of a gentle slope on the other
side of a hollow, a column of the enemy, about 5,000 strong,
was seen echeloned in two long lines on the left, or opposite
that face which was formed by the mounted infantry and
heavy cavalry, and looking as if they meant to come on now.
</p>

<p>
They were still marshalled, as stated, by sheikhs and
dervishes on horseback, and, with all their banners rustling
in the wind, the battle-drums thundering, and their shrill
cries of 'Allah!  Allah!' loading the air, they advanced
quickly, brandishing their flashing spears and two-handed
swords.  Abu Saleh, Ameer of Metemneh, led the right;
Moussa Abu Hagil led the centre; and Mahommed Khuz,
Ameer of Berber, who had soon to retire wounded, led
the left, and our skirmishers came racing towards the
square.
</p>

<p>
Strange to say, our fire as yet seemed to have little effect
upon the foe; very few were falling, and the untouched began
to believe that the spells of Osman Digna and the promises
of the Mahdi had rendered their bodies shot-proof; and
when within three hundred yards of the square they began
to rush over the undulating ground like a vast wave of black
surf.  Now the Gardner gun was brought into action; but
when most required, and at a moment full of peril, the
wretched Government ammunition failed to act&mdash;the
cartridges stuck ere the third round was fired; the human
waves of Arabs came rolling down upon the square, leaping
and yelling over their dead and wounded, never reeling nor
wavering under the close sheets of lead that tore through
them now.
</p>

<p>
Like fiends let loose they came surging and swooping on,
their burnished weapons flashing, and their black brawny
forms standing boldly out in the glow of the sunshine,
unchecked by the hailstorm of bullets, spearing the horsemen
around the useless Gardner gun, and fighting hand to hand,
Abu Saleh and the Sheikh Moussa leading them on, and
then it was that the gallant Colonel Burnaby, of the Blues,
fell like the hero he was.
</p>

<p>
The wild and high desire to do something that might win
him a name, and make, perhaps, Hester Maule proud of
him, welled up in the heart of Malcolm Skene, even at that
terrible crisis, and he spurred his horse forward a few paces,
just as Burnaby had done, to succour some of the skirmishers,
who, borne back by the Arab charge, had failed to reach the
protection of the square, which was formed in the grand
old British fashion, shoulder to shoulder like a living
wall.
</p>

<p>
By one trenchant, back-handed stroke of his sword, he
nearly swept the head off the yelling Arab, thereby saving
from the latter's spear a Foot Guardsman, who had stumbled
ere he could reach the square; but now Skene was furiously
charged by another, who bore the standard of Sheikh
Moussa.
</p>

<p>
Grasping his spear by his bridle hand, he ran his sword
fairly through the Arab, who fell backward in a heap over
his horse's crupper, and then Skene tore from his dying grip
the banner, which was of green silk&mdash;the holy colour&mdash;edged
with red, and bore a verse of the Koran in gold (for
it was a gift from the Mahdi), and, regaining the shelter of
the square, threw his trophy at the foot of the General.
</p>

<p>
'This shall go to the Queen&mdash;in your name, Captain
Skene!' said the latter.
</p>

<p>
'The Queen&mdash;no, sir&mdash;but to a girl in Scotland, I hope,
whether I live or not!' replied Malcolm.
</p>

<p>
It was sent to the Queen at Windsor eventually, however,
for Malcolm, now, when the square, recoiling before the
dreadful rush, had receded about a hundred yards, and the
Arabs were charging our men breast high, and the Heavies,
instead of remaining steady as infantry would have done,
true to their cavalry instincts were springing forward to
close with the foe, once more dashed to the front in
headlong fashion, and found himself beyond the face of the
square, opposed to a tribe of Ghazis, who were brandishing
their spears, hurling javelins, and hewing right and left with
their two-handed swords&mdash;all swarthy negroes from
Kordofan, and copper-coloured Arabs of the Bayuda Desert
with long, straight, floating hair.
</p>

<p>
Heedless of death&mdash;nay, rather courting it as the path to
paradise&mdash;with weapons levelled or uplifted, they came
forward, with blood pouring from their bullet wounds in many
instances, some staggering under these till they dropped
and died within five paces of the square, while the others
rushed on, and the fight became hand to hand, the bayonet
meeting the Arab spear.  On our side there was not much
shouting as yet, only a brief cry, an oath, or a short exclamation
of prayer or agony as a soldier fell down in his place,
and all the valour of the Heavies became unavailing, when
their formation was broken, when the foe mingled with
them, and they were driven back upon the Naval Brigade,
with its still useless Gardner gun, upon the right of the
Sussex Regiment, which strove to close up the gap.
</p>

<p>
Then it was that Skene found himself opposed to Moussa
Abu Hagil, whose horse had been shot under him, and who,
half-blinded by his own blood streaming from a bullet-wound
from which his Darfour helmet failed to save him, fought
like a wild animal, slashing about with his double-edged
sword, which broke in his hand, and then using his
spear.
</p>

<p>
Dashing at Skene with a demoniac yell, he levelled the
long blade of the weapon at his throat.  Parrying the thrust
by a circular sweep of his sword, Skene checked his horse
and reined it backwards; but the length of Skeikh Moussa's
spear, nearly ten feet, put it out of his power to return with
proper interest the fury of the attack.  Twice at least his
sword touched the Arab, thus making him, if more wary, all
the more eager and fierce, and there was a grim and defiant
smile on Skene's face as he fenced with Moussa and parried
his thrusts; but now he was attacked by others when scarcely
his horse's length from the face of the square.
</p>

<p>
One wounded him in the right shoulder; Skene turned
in his saddle and clove him down.  At that moment a
soldier&mdash;the young lad of the 2nd Sussex to whom he gave
his water-bottle at the well of Abu Haifa&mdash;ran from the
ranks and attacked another assailant of Skene, but perished
under twenty spears, and ere the latter could deliver one
blow again, he was dragged from his saddle, covered with
wounds in the neck and face&mdash;ghastly wounds from which
the blood was streaming&mdash;'each a death to nature,' and
literally hewn to pieces.
</p>

<p>
So thus, eventually, was his strange presentiment fulfilled!
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Ghazis had forced their way so far into
the square that one was actually slain in the act of firing
the battery ammunition.  Despite the great efforts of a
gallant Captain Verner and others, 'the Heavies were being
massacred; and after the fall of Burnaby, whom Sir William
Cumming, of the Scots Guards, tried to save, Verner was
beaten down, but his life (it is recorded) was saved by Major
Carmichael, of the Irish Lancers, whose dead body fell across
him, as well as those of three Ghazis.'
</p>

<p>
The Earl of Airlie and Lord Beresford, fighting sword in
hand, were both wounded, and so furious was the inrush of
the Arabs, that many of them reached the heart of the
square, where they slew the maimed and dying in the
litters, and rushed hither and thither, with shrill yells,
streaming hair, and flashing eyes, until they were all shot
down or bayoneted to death.
</p>

<p>
Fighting for life and vengeance, and half maddened to
find that their cartridges jammed hard and fast after the
third shot, our soldiers&mdash;in some instances placed back to
back&mdash;fought on the summit of a mound surrounded by
thousands upon thousands of dark-skinned spearmen and
swordsmen, hurling their strength on what were originally
the left and rear faces of the square, till, with all its defects,
our fire became so deadly and withering, that they began to
waver, recoil, and eventually fly, while the triumphant cheers
of our men rent the welkin.
</p>

<p>
Away went the Arabs streaming in full flight towards
Berber, Metemneh, and the road to Khartoum, followed
by Barrow and his Hussars cutting them down like ripened
grain, and followed, to the screaming, plunging, and
crashing fire of the screw guns which now came into action
and pursuit with shot and shell.
</p>

<p>
So the field and the walls of Abu Klea were won, but
dearly, as we had 135 other ranks killed, and above 200
wounded, including camel drivers and other camp followers.
</p>

<p>
The former were buried by the men of the 19th Hussars.
Earth to earth&mdash;dust to dust&mdash;ashes to ashes; three carbine
volleys rang above them in farewell, and all was over; while
the native slain were left in their thousands to the birds of
the air.
</p>

<p>
The column reached the city of Abu Klea in the evening,
and then, parched and choked with thirst after the heat
and toil and fierce excitement of the past night and day, all
enjoyed the supreme luxury of the cold water from the
fifty springs or more that bubbled in the Wady.  Round
these, men, horses, and camels gathered to quench their
thirst, that amounted to agony, by deep and repeated
draughts, while fires were lighted and a meal prepared.
</p>

<p>
Next followed the battle of Gubat and the futile expedition
of Sir Charles Wilson, both of which are somewhat apart
from our story.
</p>

<p>
The death of Colonel Burnaby, of the Blues, created a
profound sensation in London society, where he was a
great favourite; but there were many more than he to
sorrow for.
</p>

<p>
Skene's fall made a deep impression among the Staffordshire,
as he was greatly beloved by the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Malcolm&mdash;killed at last!' said Roland, when the
tidings came up the river to the bivouac at Hamdab.  He
should never see his brown, dark eyes again; feel the firm
clasp of his friendly hand, or hear his cheery voice
say&mdash;'Well, Roland&mdash;old fellow!'
</p>

<p>
'But it may be my turn next,' thought he.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Malcolm!' said Jack Elliot; 'I have known him
nurse the sick, bury the dead, sit for hours playing with a
soldier's ailing child, and once he swam a mile and more to
save a poor dog from drowning.
</p>

<p>
And as he spoke, sometimes a tearless sob shook
Elliot's sturdy frame, and Roland knew that with his friend
Malcolm
</p>

CHAPTER LIII
<br /><br />
A HOMEWARD GLANCE.
</h3>

<p>
The action of one human being on another, by subtle
means, it has been said, is as effective as the action of light
on the air: that under the influence of Hawkey Sharpe
and certain new circumstances, Annot Drummond had
visibly deteriorated already.
</p>

<p>
Her high-flown ideas and undoubtedly better breeding
had caused her to experience many a shock when in the
daily and hourly society of her husband, with all his vulgar
and horsey ways, and he was certainly far below that young
lady's high-pitched expectations and her love of externals.
</p>

<p>
Her life at Earlshaugh had at first been getting quite like
a story, she thought, and a perplexingly interesting story, too,
with the high game she had to play for&mdash;a game in
manoeuvres worthy of Machiavelli himself.
</p>

<p>
Annot, we know, was not tall; but her slight figure was
prettily rounded.  She carried herself well, though too
quick and impulsive in her movements for real dignity, and
as Maude had said, she never could conceive her at the head
of a household, or taking a place in society.  Now, as the
wife of 'a cad' like Hawkey Sharpe, the latter was not to
be thought of.
</p>

<p>
Her pretty ways and glittering golden hair, which had
misled better men than the wretched Sharpe, were palling
even upon him, now; and her studied artlessness had given
place to a bearing born of vanity and her own success and
ambition, the sequel of which she was yet to learn, but
withal she was not yet lady of Earlshaugh.  But, as a writer
says of a similar character, 'a self-love, that demon who
besets alike the learned philosopher with his own pet
theories; the statesman with his pet political hobbies; the
man of wealth with his own aggrandisement; and the man
of toil with his own pet prejudices&mdash;that insidious demon
had entire hold now of this silly little girl's heart, and closed
it to anything higher.'
</p>

<p>
Married now, and safe in position as she thought herself,
Annot was no longer the coaxing and cooing little creature
she had been to Hawkey Sharpe; and rough and selfish
though he was, a flash of her eyes, or a curl of her lip cowed
him at times.  She treated him as one for whom she was
bound to entertain a certain amount of marital affection,
but no respect whatever, and when she contrasted him with
Roland Lindsay and other men she had known, even poor,
weak Bob Hoyle, her manner became one of contempt and,
occasionally, disgust.
</p>

<p>
But she had preferred the <i>couleur d'or</i> to the <i>couleur de
rose</i> in matrimony, and had now, as Hawkey said, 'to ride
the ford as she found it.'
</p>

<p>
'Men like Roland,' said Annot to Mrs. Lindsay when
discussing her whilom lover, 'especially military men, see a
good deal of life, and experience teaches them how passing
a love affair may be.'
</p>

<p>
'You mean&mdash;&mdash;' began Mrs. Lindsay, scarcely knowing
what to say.
</p>

<p>
'I mean that he must have played with fire pretty often,'
said Annot, laughing, but not pleasantly, 'and will forget
me as he must have forgotten others.  I suppose our likes
and dislikes in this world are based upon the point that
somebody likes or dislikes ourselves.'
</p>

<p>
Hawkey Sharpe's debts and demands since his marriage
had exhausted the patience if not quite the finances of his
sister: and now the bill, erewhile referred to&mdash;the racing
debt&mdash;was falling inexorably due, and how to meet it, or be
stigmatised as a 'welsher' on every course in the country,
became a source of some anxiety to that gentleman.
</p>

<p>
To meet his other requirements, all the fine timber in the
King's Wood was gone&mdash;a clean sweep had been made
from King James's Thorn to the Joug Tree, that bears an
iron collar, in which for centuries the offenders on the
domains of Earlshaugh had suffered durance, and the once
finely foliaged hill now looked bare and strange; and for
angry remarks thereat, Willie Wardlaw, the gardener, and
Gavin Fowler, the head gamekeeper, aged dependants on
the house of Earlshaugh, as their fathers had been before
them, had been summarily dismissed by Mr. Hawkey Sharpe.
</p>

<p>
A well-known firm of shipbuilders on the Clyde had
offered for the wood, and to the former the most attractive
part of the transaction, in addition to the good price, was
the fact that the money was paid down at once but it was
far from satisfying the wants of Mr. Hawkey Sharpe.
</p>

<p>
'You know I disliked having that timber sold&mdash;that I
hated the mere thought of having it cut!' said Deborah to
him reproachfully, as she looked from the window into the
sunshine.
</p>

<p>
'Why?' he asked sulkily; 'what the devil was the use of it?'
</p>

<p>
'It was the favourite feature in the landscape&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Of whom?'
</p>

<p>
'My dead husband.'
</p>

<p>
'Bosh!' exclaimed Hawkey, who thought this was (what,
to do her justice, it was not) 'twaddle.'
</p>

<p>
They were together in his sanctum, or 'den,' which
passed occasionally as his office; though the table, like the
mantelpiece, was strewed with pipes, their ashes were everywhere,
and the air was generally redolent of somewhat coarse
tobacco smoke.
</p>

<p>
Having a favour to ask, he had, in his own fashion, been
screwing his courage to the sticking-point.
</p>

<p>
'You have been imbibing&mdash;drinking again?' said his pale
sister, eyeing him contemptuously with her cold, glittering
stare.
</p>

<p>
'"I take a little wine for my stomach's sake and other
infirmities," as we find in 1st Timothy,' said he with a
twinkle in his shifty eyes.
</p>

<p>
'The devil can quote Scripture, so well may you.'
</p>

<p>
'That is severe, Deb,' said he, filling his pipe.
</p>

<p>
'Come to the point.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, Deb, dear, would it be convenient to you to&mdash;to
lend me a couple of thousand pounds for a few weeks?  I
have hinted of this from time to time.'
</p>

<p>
'Two thousand pounds!  Not only inconvenient, but impossible,'
said she, twisting her rings about in nervous anger.
</p>

<p>
'Why, Deb?'
</p>

<p>
'I have not even a fifty-pound note in the house.'
</p>

<p>
'But plenty lying idle at your banker's.'
</p>

<p>
'Not the sum you seek to borrow just now.  Borrow!
Why not be candid, and ask for it out and out?  Two
thousand&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I must have the money, I tell you,' he said, with sudden
temper, 'or&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What?'
</p>

<p>
'Be disgraced&mdash;that is all,' he replied, sullenly lighting
his huge briar-root.
</p>

<p>
'Well, you must find it without my aid,' said she, coldly
and sullenly too.
</p>

<p>
'Could you not raise it on some of your useless jewels?
Come, now, dear old Deb, don't be too hard upon a
fellow.'
</p>

<p>
Anger made her pale cheek suffuse at this cool suggestion,
and she became very much agitated.
</p>

<p>
'Now, don't cut up this way.  It is your heart again, of
course; but keep quiet, and let nothing trouble you,' said
he, puffing vigorously.  'You have a lot of the Lindsay
jewels that are too old-fashioned for even you to wear.'
</p>

<p>
'But not to bequeath.'
</p>

<p>
'To Annot?' said he, brightening a little.
</p>

<p>
'I am sick of you and your Annot,' exclaimed Mrs. Lindsay,
now all aflame with anger, and trembling violently.
</p>

<p>
'Sorry to hear it,' said he, somewhat mockingly.  'We
have not yet quite got over our spooning.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't use that horrid, vulgar phrase, Hawkey.'
</p>

<p>
'Vulgar!  How?'
</p>

<p>
'One no doubt derived from the gipsies, when two used
one horn spoon.  Annot, with all her apparent amiable
imbecility, is a remarkably acute young woman.'
</p>

<p>
'She is&mdash;and does credit to my taste, Deb.'
</p>

<p>
'One whom it is impossible to dislike, I admit.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course.'
</p>

<p>
'And also quite impossible to love.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, come now, poor Annot!' said Hawkey, with a kind
of mock deprecation; and then to gain favour he said, 'I
do wish, dear Deb, that you would see the doctor
again&mdash;about yourself.'
</p>

<p>
'I have seen him; the old story, he can do nothing but
order me to avoid all agitation, yet you have not given me
much chance of that lately.'
</p>

<p>
'But just once again, Deb&mdash;about this money&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Another word on the subject and we part for ever!' she
exclaimed, and giving him a glance&mdash;stony as the stare of
Medusa&mdash;one such as he had never before seen in her
small, keen, and steely-gray eyes, she flung away and left
him.
</p>

<p>
He gnashed his teeth, smashed his pipe on the floor, then
lit a huge regalia to soothe his susceptibilities, and thought
about <i>how</i> the money was to be raised.  He knew his sister
had thousands idle in the bank, and have it he should at all
hazards!
</p>

<p>
He had meant, too, if successful, and he found her
pliable, to have spoken to her again about making her will;
but certainly the present did not seem a favourable
occasion to do so.
</p>

<p>
'Deb will be getting her palpitation of the heart, nervous
attacks, low spirits, and the devil only knows all what more,
on the head of this!' he muttered with a malediction.
</p>

<p>
Hawkey had watched her retire through the deep old
doorway (under the lintel of which tall Cardinal Beatoun
had whilom stooped his head) and disappear along the
stately corridor beyond.  Then he dropped into an
easy-chair&mdash;stirred the fire restlessly and impatiently, and drained
his glass, only to refill it&mdash;his face the while fraught with
rage and mischief.
</p>

<p>
He drew a letter or two from a drawer&mdash;they were from
his sister&mdash;and he proceeded to study her signature with
much artistic acumen and curiosity.
</p>

<p>
'Needs must when the devil drives!' said he, grinding his
teeth and biting his spiky nails; 'I have done it&mdash;and that
she'll know in time!'
</p>

<p>
Done what?
</p>

<p>
That the reader will know in time too.

<h3>
CHAPTER LIV.
<br /><br />
THE LONG-SUSPENDED SWORD.
</h3>

<p>
Sorrow is said to make people sometimes, to a certain
extent, selfish; thus sorrow in her own little secluded home
was, ere long, to render Hester, for a space at least, less
thoughtful of the grief which affected her cousin Maude.
</p>

<p>
Hester was somewhat changed, and knew within herself
that it was so.
</p>

<p>
She found that her daily thoughts ran more anxiously and
tenderly upon her father, and about his fast-failing health,
than on any other subject now.
</p>

<p>
She lost even a naturally feminine interest in her own
beauty.  Who was there to care for it? she thought.
</p>

<p>
So on Sundays she sat in her pew, in the kirk on the
wooded hill, and there listened to the preacher's voice
blending with the rustle of the trees and the cawing of the
rooks in the ruined fane close by; but with an emotion in
her heart never known before&mdash;that of feeling that ere long
she would have a greater need of some one to lean on&mdash;of
something to cling to in the coming loneliness that her heart
foreboded to be near now.
</p>

<p>
At last there came a day she was never to forget&mdash;a day
that told her desolation was at hand.
</p>

<p>
Seated in his Singapore chair at breakfast one morning,
her father suddenly grew deadly pale; a spasm convulsed
his features; his coffee-cup fell from his nerveless hand;
and he gazed at her with all the terror and anguish in his
eyes which he saw in her own.
</p>

<p>
'Papa&mdash;papa!' she exclaimed, and sprang to his side.
He gazed at her wildly, vacantly, and muttered something
about 'the Jhansi bullet.'  Then she heard him distinctly
articulate her name.
</p>

<p>
'Hester&mdash;my own darling&mdash;you here?' he said, with an
effort; 'how sweet you look in that white robe.  I always
loved you in it, dear.'
</p>

<p>
'My dress is rose-coloured&mdash;a morning wrapper, papa,'
said Hester, as the little hope that gathered in her heart
passed away.
</p>

<p>
'So white&mdash;so pure&mdash;just like your marriage-dress,
Hester!  But you wore it the first day I saw you, long
ago&mdash;long ago&mdash;at Earlshaugh, when you stood in the Red
Drawing-room&mdash;and gave me a bouquet of violets from
your breast.  My own Hester!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, papa&mdash;papa!' moaned the poor girl in dire distress,
for she knew he spoke not of her but of her mother, who
had reposed for years under the trees in the old kirkyard
on the hill; and a choking sob of dismay escaped her.
</p>

<p>
It was a stroke of paralysis that had fallen upon the
Indian veteran, and he was borne to his bed, which he
never left alive.
</p>

<p>
Hour after hour did Maude hang over him, listening to
his fevered breathing, and futile moanings, which no
medical skill could repress or soothe; and the long day,
and the terrible night&mdash;every minute seemed an age&mdash;passed
on, and still the pallid girl watched there in the hopeless
agony of looking for death and not for life.
</p>

<p>
That long night&mdash;one of the earliest of winter&mdash;was at
last on its way towards morning.
</p>

<p>
All was still in the glen of the Esk save the murmur of
the mountain stream and the rustle of the leaves in the
shrubberies without, and there was a strange loneliness, a
solemnity, in Hester's mind as she thought of Merlwood in
its solitariness, with death and life, time and eternity, so
nigh each other under its roof; and the ceaseless ticking of
an antique clock in the hall fell like strokes of thunder on
her brain, till she stopped it, lest the sound might disturb
the invalid.
</p>

<p>
And in that time of supreme anxiety and sorrow the
lonely girl thought of her only kinsman, Roland Lindsay&mdash;the
friend of her childhood and early girlhood&mdash;the merry,
handsome, dark-haired fellow, who taught her to ride and
row and fish, and whom she loved still with a soft yet
passionate affection, that was strong as in the old days, for
all that had come and gone between them.
</p>

<p>
Would he ever return&mdash;return to her and be as he had
been before&mdash;before Annot Drummond came?
</p>

<p>
Another and a fatal stroke came speedily and mercifully;
the long-suspended sword had fallen at last, and the old
soldier was summoned to his last home!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A few days after saw Hester prostrate in her own bed and
in the hands of the doctors, her rich dark-brown hair shorn
short from her throbbing temples, feverish and faint, with
dim eyes and pallid lips that murmured unconsciously of
past times, of the distant and the dead&mdash;of her parents, of
camps and cantonments far away; of little brothers and
sisters who were in heaven; of green meadows, of garden
flowers and summer evenings, when she and Roland had
rambled together; and then of Egypt and the war in the
deserts by the Nile.
</p>

<p>
After a time, when the early days of February came,
when the mellow-voiced merle and the speckle-breasted
mavis were heard in the woods by the Esk; when the
silver-edged gowans starred the grassy banks, and the
newly-dug earth gave forth a refreshing odour, and everywhere
there were pleasant and hopeful signs that the dreary
reign of winter was nearly over, Hester became conscious
of her surroundings, but at first only partially so.
</p>

<p>
'Maude,' said she, in a weak voice to a watcher, 'dear
Maude&mdash;are you there?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied the cousin, drawing the sick girl's head
upon her bosom.  'Oh, Hester&mdash;my poor darling, how ill
you have been!'
</p>

<p>
'Ill&mdash;I ill?  I thought it was papa,' she said, with dilated
eyes.  'Is he well now?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied Maude, in a choking voice, 'well&mdash;very
well; but drink this, dearest.'
</p>

<p>
'Where is papa&mdash;can I see him?  Will you or the doctor
take me to him?'
</p>

<p>
'He is not here,' began the perplexed Maude.
</p>

<p>
'Not here; where then?'
</p>

<p>
'You must wait, Hester, till you are well and strong&mdash;well
and strong; you must not speak or think&mdash;but eat.'
</p>

<p>
Then a feeble smile that made Maude's tender heart ache
stole over Hester's pale face.
</p>

<p>
'Where <i>is</i> papa?' the latter exclaimed suddenly, with a
shrill ring of hysterics in her voice.  'Ah&mdash;I know&mdash;I
remember now,' she added, with a smile, 'he is dead&mdash;dead!'
</p>

<p>
'Born again, rather say, my darling,' whispered poor
Maude, choked with tears, as she nestled Hester's face in
her neck.
</p>

<p>
'Dead&mdash;dead; and I am alone in the world!' moaned
Hester, as a hot shower of tears relieved her, and she
turned her face to the wall, while convulsive sobs shook her
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
In time she was able to leave her bed&mdash;to feel herself
well, if weak&mdash;deplorably weak, and knew that she had
resolutely and inexorably to face the world of life.
</p>

<p>
A pile of letters occupied her, luckily, for a time&mdash;letters
that were sad if soothing&mdash;all full of sympathy, tenderness,
and sincere regret, profound esteem, and so forth, for the
brave old man who was gone; even there was one from
Annot, but none from Roland or Jack.
</p>

<p>
Where were they?  Far away, alas! where postal arrangements
were vague and most uncertain.
</p>

<p>
We have said that Hester had the world to face.  Her
father's pay and pension died with him, and suddenly the
girl was all but penniless.  Her father had been unable to
put away any money for her.  People thought he might and
ought to have managed better; but so it was.
</p>

<p>
Sir Henry's Indian relics, his treasured household gods,
such as the tulwar of the Amazonian Ranee of Jhansi, who
fought and died as a trooper when Tantia Topee strove to
save the lost cause, all of which had to Hester a halo of
love and superstition of the heart about them, were brought
to the auctioneer's hammer inexorably, and with the money
realised therefrom she thought to look about for some such
situation or employment as might become one in her
unfortunate position.
</p>

<p>
As the relics went, her conscience smote her now, for the
recollection of how often she had grown weary over the
oft repeated Indian reminiscences of the poor old man, who
lived in the past quite as much, if not more, than in the
present.  What would she not give to hear his voice once
again!  And she remembered now how fond he was of
quoting the words of 'The Ancient Brahmin':
</p>

<p>
'Happy is he who endeth the business of his life before
his death....  Avoid not death, for it is a weakness; fear
it not, for thou understandest not what it is; all thou
certainly knowest is, that it putteth an end to thy sorrows.
Think not the longest life the happiest; that which is best
employed doth the man most honour, and himself shall
rejoice after death in the advantages of it.'
</p>

<p>
Like other girls who are imaginative and impressionable,
she had built her <i>châteaux en Espagne</i>, innocent edifices
enough, and romantic too, but now they had crumbled
away, leaving not one stone upon another.  Her future
seemed fixed irrevocably; no idle dreams could be there,
but a life that would, too probably, be blank and dreary even
unto the end.
</p>

<p>
We cannot be in the world and grieve at all times; but
yet one may feel a sorrow for ever.
</p>

<p>
'I shall go and earn my living, Maude&mdash;be a governess,
or something,' she said, as her plans began to mature.  'It
cannot be difficult to teach little children; though I always
hated my own lessons, I know, even when helped
by&mdash;Roland.'
</p>

<p>
'Nonsense, Hester!' exclaimed Maude; 'you shall live
with me and&mdash;and Jack, if he ever returns, and all is well.
You are too pretty to be a governess; no wise matron would
have you.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because all the grown sons and brothers would be falling
in love with you.  So you must stay with me.'
</p>

<p>
But Hester was resolute.
</p>

<p>
To the many letters of the former&mdash;letters agonising in
tenor&mdash;addressed to Jack Elliot and to her brother Roland,
no answer ever came, while weeks became months; for
many difficulties just then attended the correspondence of
the troops that were on the arduous expedition for the relief
of Khartoum.
</p>

<p>
Thus, amid all the sorrows of Hester, how keen and great
was the anxiety of Maude!
</p>

<p>
Jack, her husband&mdash;if he <i>was</i> her husband&mdash;was now
face to face with the enemy&mdash;those terrible Soudanese&mdash;and
might perish in the field, by drowning, or by fever,
before she could ever have elucidated the mystery, the
cloud, the horrible barrier that had come between them.
</p>

<p>
At times the emotions that shook the tender form of
Maude were terrible, since the night of that woman's visit,
when the iron seemed to enter her soul; and there descended
upon her a darkness through which there had come no gleam
of light.
</p>

<p>
The past and the future seemed all absorbed in the blank
misery of the present, and as if her life was to be one career
of abiding shame, emptiness, and misery, as a dishonoured
wife&mdash;if wife she was at all!
</p>

<p>
Hawkey Sharpe had inflicted the revengeful blow; the
woman, his degraded tool, had disappeared, and her story
remained undisproved as yet.  Jack, as we have said, might
perish in Egypt, and the truth or the falsehood of that odious
story would then be buried in his grave!
</p>

<p>
The pretty villa near the Grange Loan&mdash;the wood-shaded
Loan that led of old to St. Giles's Grange&mdash;she now went
near no more; it was torture to go back there&mdash;her home
it never could be.  Turn which way she would, her haggard
eyes rested on some reminder of Jack's love or his presence
there&mdash;their mutual household Lares: her piano, Jack's
carefully selected gift; the music on the stand, chosen by
him, and with his name and 'love' inscribed to her,
just as she had left it; books, statuettes&mdash;pretty nothings,
alas!
</p>

<p>
Her mind now pointed to no definite course; she felt
like a rudderless ship drifting through dark and stormy
waters before a cruel blast; in all, her being there was
no distinct resolution as yet what to do or whither to
turn.
</p>

<p>
Yet, calm as she seemed outwardly, there was in her
tortured heart a passionate longing for peace, and peace
meant, perhaps, death!
</p>

<p>
And all this undeserved agony was but the result of a
most artful but pitiful and vulgar vengeance!
</p>

<p>
Whether born of thoughts caused by recent stirring news
from the seat of war, we know not; but one night Hester
woke from a dream of Roland&mdash;after a feverish and sleep-haunted
doze&mdash;haunted as if by the spiritual presence of one
who&mdash;bodily, at least&mdash;was far away.
</p>

<p>
Waking with a start, she heard a familiar and firm step
upon the staircase, and then a door opened&mdash;the door of
that room which Roland had always occupied when at
Merlwood.
</p>

<p>
'Roland&mdash;Roland!' she cried in terror, and then roused
Maude.
</p>

<p>
There was, of course, no response, but a sound seemed
to pass into that identical room; she fancied she heard
steps&mdash;his familiar steps moving about, but as if he trod
softly&mdash;cautiously.
</p>

<p>
Terror seized her, and her heart seemed to die within
her breast.
</p>

<p>
She sprang from bed, clasped Maude's hand, and went
softly, mechanically to the room.  It was empty, and the
cold light of the waning moon flooded it from end to end,
making it seem alike lone and ghostly.
</p>

<p>
Her imagination had played her false; but she was painfully
haunted by the memory of that dream and the palpable
sounds that, after waking, had followed it; and hourly, in
her true spirit of Scottish superstition, expected to hear of
fatal tidings from the seat of war&mdash;like her who, of old, had
watched by the Weird Yett of Earlshaugh.
</p>

<p>
Like poor Malcolm Skene was she, too, to have her
presentiment&mdash;her prevision of sorrow to come?
</p>

<p>
It almost seemed so.
</p>

<p>
But her thoughts now clung persistently to the hero of
her girlish days; he had behaved faithlessly, uncertainly to
her, she thought; yet, perhaps, he might come back to her
some day, if God spared him, and then he would find the
old and tender love awaiting him still.
</p>

<p>
Yet Roland might come home and marry <i>someone else</i>!
No man, she had heard, went through life remembering
and regretting one woman for ever.  Was it indeed so?
</p>

<p>
But after the night of her strange dream the morning
papers contained the brief, yet terrible, telegram stating that
a battle had been fought at a place called Kirbekan, by
General Earle's column (of which the Staffordshire formed
a part), but that no details thereof had come to hand.
</p>

<p>
The recent calamity she had undergone rendered Hester's
heart apprehensive that she might soon have to undergo
another.
</p>

<p>
And ere the lengthened news of the battle did come, she
and Maude had left Edinburgh, as they anticipated, perhaps
for ever.

<h3>
CHAPTER LV.
<br /><br />
WITH GENERAL EARLE's COLUMN.
</h3>

<p>
While the column of Brigadier Sir Herbert Stewart was
toiling amid thirst and other sufferings across the vast waste
of the Bayuda Desert, and gaining the well-fought battles of
Abu Klea and Abu Kru, the column of Brigadier Earle had
gone by boats up the Nile to avenge the cruel assassination
of Gordon's comrade and coadjutor, Colonel Donald Stewart,
on Suliman Wad Gamr and the somewhat ubiquitous Moussa
Abu Hagil with all their people.
</p>

<p>
The succession of cataracts rendered the General's progress
very slow; thus the 4th of January found his advanced
force, the gallant South Staffordshire, only encamped at
Hamdab, as we have stated a few chapters back.
</p>

<p>
Suliman, on being joined by Moussa a few days after Abu
Klea, had fallen back from Berti, thus rendering it necessary
for General Earle to push on in pursuit, through a rocky,
broken, and savage country, bad for all military operations,
and altogether impracticable for cavalry.
</p>

<p>
On the river the Rahami cataract proved one of great
danger and difficulty, and severe indeed was the labour of
getting up the boats.  There the bed of Old Nile is broken
up by black and splintered rocks, between which it rushes in
snowy foam with mighty force and volume.
</p>

<p>
The boats had to be tracked up the entire distance, often
with many sharp turns to avoid sunken rocks in the chasms;
and, as a large number of men were required for each boat,
the column, comprising the Staffordshire, the Black Watch,
a squadron of Hussars, and the Egyptian camel corps, with
two guns, had work enough and to spare.  'The perils and
difficulties,' we are told, 'were quite as great as any hitherto
encountered on the passage up the Nile.  For the last six
miles below Birti the river takes an acute angle, and then as
sharply resumes its former course.  The Royal Highlanders
were first up; but after they got their boats through, another
channel was discovered on the western side of the stream,
and as it turned out to be less difficult, the succeeding
regiments were enabled to come up more quickly.
</p>

<p>
Roland's regiment remained in a few days encamped at
Hamdab.  'We are now leading the whole army,' says its
Colonel, the gallant and ill-fated Eyre, in his 'Diary,' 'and
are the first British troops that have ever been up the
Nile.'
</p>

<p>
On the 6th of January there was a sand-storm from dawn
till sunset; it covered the unfortunate troops, who seemed
to be in a dark cloud for the whole day.  Around them for
a hundred miles the country was all rocks, and yet bore
traces of once having a vast population.
</p>

<p>
At Hamdab the river teemed with wild geese&mdash;beautiful
gray birds, with scarlet breasts and gold wings.  Dick
Mostyn shot one, which Roland's soldier servant prepared
for their repast in a stew, that was duly enjoyed in the
latter's quarters&mdash;a hut made of palm branches and long
dhurra grass; while their comrade Wilton, when scouting on
Berber road, captured a couple of Arabs, who gave the
column a false alarm by tidings of an attack at daybreak,
thus keeping all under arms till the sun rose.
</p>

<p>
The 18th was Sunday, when Colonel Eyre read prayers
on parade, and three days after came tidings of the battle of
Abu Klea, the death of Burnaby, after all his hair-breadth
escapes, and of many other brave men.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Malcolm&mdash;poor Malcolm!' said Roland; 'what
dire news this will be for his old mother at Dunnimarle.
This event gives you your company in the corps&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Don't speak of it!' interrupted Mostyn, with something
like a groan; 'I would to Heaven that poor Skene had
never given me such a chance.'
</p>

<p>
The last days of January saw Earle's column making
a sweep with fire and sword of the district in which poor
Colonel Stewart and his companions had been murdered;
and on the 2nd of February it had reached a country
beyond all conception or description wild, and quite
uninhabited.
</p>

<p>
The sufferings of Earle's troops were considerably severe
now.  The faces and the knees of the Highlanders were
skinned by the chill air at night and the burning sun by
day; while, in addition, there were insects in the sand, so
minute as to be almost invisible, yet they got into the
men's ragged clothing, and bit hands and feet so that they
were painfully swollen.
</p>

<p>
On the 9th of February Earle's column reached Kirbekan,
near the island of Dulka, seventy miles above Merawi,
which is a peninsular district of Southern Nubia, and the
enemy, above 2,000 strong, led by Moussa Abu Hagil, Ali
Wad Aussein, and other warlike Sheikhs, and chiefly
composed of the guilty Monnassir tribe, some Robatats and
a force of Dervishes from Berber, were known to be in
position at no great distance; thus a battle was imminent.
</p>

<p>
Ere it took place Roland Lindsay and his friend Elliot
were destined to hear some startling news from home.  At
this time all papers and parcels for the column got no
further than Dongola, but a few letters from the rear were
brought up, and the mail-bag contained one of importance
for Roland, and several for his friend Dick Mostyn.
</p>

<p>
Lounging on the grass, under a mimosa tree, with a
cigarette between his teeth, and with just the same lazy,
<i>debonnair</i> bearing with which he had taken in many a girl
at home in pleasant England, lay Dick Mostyn reading
his missives.  Some he perused with a quiet, <i>insouciant</i>
smile; they were evidently from some of the girls in
question.  Others he tore into small shreds and scattered
on the breeze; they were duns.  How pleasant it was to
dispose of them thus on the bank of the Nile!
</p>

<p>
Roland, a little way apart, was perusing his solitary
letter.
</p>

<p>
It was from Mr. M'Wadsett, the W.S., dated several
weeks back, from 'Thistle Court, Thistle Street, Edinburgh'
(how well Roland remembered the gloomy place under the
shadow of St. Andrew's Church, and the purpose of his
last visit there!); and it proved quite a narrative, and one
of the deepest interest to him.
</p>

<p>
His uncle, Sir Harry, was dead, and his daughter Hester
was going forth into the world as a companion or governess.
(Dead! thought Roland; poor old Sir Harry!&mdash;and Hester,
alone now&mdash;oh, how he longed to be with her&mdash;to comfort
and protect her!)
</p>

<p>
But to be a governess&mdash;a companion&mdash;where, and to
whom?  His heart felt wrung, and he mentally rehearsed
all he had heard or read&mdash;but not seen&mdash;of how such
dependents were too often treated by the prosperous and the
<i>parvenu</i>; obliged to conform to rules made by others, to
perform a hundred petty duties by hands never before soiled
by toil; to never complain, however ill or weary she might
feel; to stumble with brats through wearisome scales on an
old piano; to be banished when visitors came, and endure
endless, though often unnecessary affronts.  He uttered
a malediction, lit a cigar, and betook him again to his
letter.
</p>

<p>
'About seeking a situation, I know there is nothing else
left for the poor girl to do,' continued the writer; 'but I
besought her to wait a little&mdash;to make my house her home,
if she chose, for a time; but she told me that she did not
mind work or poverty.  I replied that she knew nothing of
either, but a sad smile and a resolute glance were my only
answer.'
</p>

<p>
The old man's love of himself, his upbraiding words when
they last parted, and his own unkind treatment (to say the
least of it) of Hester, all came surging back on Roland's
memory now.
</p>

<p>
'I shall not readily forget Miss Maule's passionate outburst
of grief and pain on leaving Merlwood,' continued the
old Writer to the Signet; 'but all there seemed for the
time to be sacred to the hallowed memories of her father,
her mother, and her past childhood!
</p>

<p>
'And next I have to relate something more startling still&mdash;the
sudden death of your stepmother, and to congratulate
you on being now the true and undoubted <i>Laird of
Earlshaugh</i>.
</p>

<p>
'Actuated, I know not precisely by what sentiment&mdash;whether
by just indignation at the character of her brother,
or by remorse for your false position with regard to the
property&mdash;Mrs. Lindsay, as an act of reparation, and to preclude
all legal action on the part of any heir of her own or of her
brother, Hawkey Sharpe, that might crop up, by a will
drawn out and prepared by myself, duly recorded at Her
Majesty's General Register House, Edinburgh, has left the
entire estate to you, precisely and in all entirety as it was
left to her.
</p>

<p>
'She sent a message when she did this.  It was simply:
"When my time comes, and I feel assured that it is not far
off now, and that I shall not see him again, he will know
that I have done my best."
</p>

<p>
'There must have been an emotion of remorse in her
mind, as I now know that for some days before the demise of
your worthy father, he eagerly urged that you should be
telegraphed for, and more than once expressed a vehement
desire to see <i>me</i>, his legal adviser, but in vain, as
Mrs. Lindsay number two and her brother Hawkey barred the
way; so the first will in the former's favour remained
unaltered.
</p>

<p>
'Since you last left home, Mr. Hawkey forged his sister's
name to a cheque for £2,000 to cover a bill or racing debt.
It duly came to hand.  Mrs. Lindsay looked at the document,
and knew in an instant that her name had been used,
and, remembering the amount of Hawkey's demand on her,
knew also that she had been shamefully and cruelly
deceived.
</p>

<p>
'The sequence of the numbers in her cheque-book
showed by the absence of the counterfoil where one had
been abstracted&mdash;that for the £2,000 payable to bearer.
In her rage she repudiated it, and the law took its
course.
</p>

<p>
'The nameless horror that is the sure precursor of
coming evil took possession of her, and then it was that
she executed in your favour the will referred to, instigated
thereto not a little by Hawkey's incessant and annoying
references to her secret ailment&mdash;disease of the heart.
</p>

<p>
'To me she seemed to have changed very much latterly.
Her tall, thin figure had lost somewhat of its erectness, and
her cold, steel-like eyes (you remember them?) were sunken
and dimmed.
</p>

<p>
'Her illness took a sudden and fatal turn at the time that
rascal Hawkey was arrested; and she was found that evening
by Mrs. Drugget, the housekeeper, and old Funnell, the
butler, dead in the Red Drawing-room.  Thus her strange
faintnesses and continued pallor were fully accounted for by
the faculty then.
</p>

<p>
'When she was dead Mr. Hawkey was disposed to snap
his fingers, believing himself the lord of everything; but
the will prepared by me precluded that, and he was
forthwith lodged by order of the Procurator-Fiscal in the
Tolbooth of Cupar, where he can hear, but not see, the
flow of the Eden.
</p>

<p>
'His wife, the late Miss Annot Drummond, on seeing
him depart with a pair of handcuffs on, displayed but small
emotions of regard or sorrow, but a great deal of indignation,
despair, and shame.  She trod to and fro upon the
floor of her room during the long watches of the entire
succeeding night, tore her golden hair, and beat her little
hands against the wall in the fury and agony of her passion
and disappointment to find herself mated to a criminal;
and now she has betaken herself to her somewhat faded
maternal home in South Belgravia, where I do not suppose
we shall care to follow her.'
</p>

<p>
'So, I am Earlshaugh again!' thought Roland with pardonable
exultation.  His old ancestral home was his once
more.  But a battle was to be fought on the morrow.
Should he survive it&mdash;escape?  He hoped so now; life was
certainly more valuable than it seemed to him before that
mail-bag came up the Nile.
</p>

<p>
Roland could not feel much regret for the extinguisher
which Fate had put upon the usurpers of his patrimony,
but he was by nature too generous not to recall, with some
emotions of a gentle kind, how Mrs. Lindsay had once
said to him in a broken voice, when he bade her farewell,
of something she meant to do, 'If it was not too late&mdash;too
late!'
</p>

<p>
And when he had asked her <i>what</i> she referred to, her
answer was that 'Time would show.'
</p>

<p>
And now time had shown.  She had certainly, after all,
liked the handsome and <i>debonnair</i> young fellow who had
treated her with that chivalrous deference so pleasant to all
women, old or young.
</p>

<p>
Roland, as he looked up at the luminous Nubian sky,
felt for a time a solemn emotion of awe and thankfulness,
curiously blended with exultant pride; that if he fell in the
battle of to-morrow he would fall, as many of his forefathers
had done, a Lindsay of Earlshaugh, but alas! the last of
his race.
</p>

<p>
'By Jove, there is a postscript&mdash;turn the page, Roland!'
exclaimed Jack Elliot, who had been noting the letter, as
mutual stock, over his brother-in-law's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
'Since writing all the foregoing,' said the postscript, 'I
find that your sister, Mrs. Elliot, appears to have had some
news, after receiving which she and Miss Hester have suddenly
left Edinburgh, but for <i>where</i> or with what intention I
am totally unable to discover.'
</p>

<p>
'News,' muttered Roland; 'what news can they have had?'
</p>

<p>
Roland, by the field telegraph rearward, <i>viâ</i>, Cairo, wired
a message to Mr. M'Wadsett for further intelligence, if he
had any to give, concerning the absentees, but no answer
came till long after the troops had got under arms to engage,
and Roland was no longer there to receive it.
</p>

<p>
'By Heaven, this infernal coil at home is becoming more
entangled!' exclaimed Jack.  'Were it not for my mother's
sake I would hope to be knocked on the head to-day.'
</p>

<p>
'Not for poor little Maude's sake?' asked Roland
reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
'God help us both!' sighed Jack.
</p>

<p>
'To every one who lives strength is given him to do his
duty,' said Roland gravely.  'Do yours, Jack, and no
more.'
</p>

<p>
'To me there seems a dash of sophistry in this advice
now; but had you ever loved as I have done&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Had I ever loved!  What do you mean?' asked Roland,
almost impatiently.  'But there go the bugles, and we must
each to his company.'
</p>

<p>
Then each, seizing the other's hand, drew his sword and
'fell in.'
</p>

<p>
The mystery involving the fate of Maude and the movements
of both her and Hester were a source of intense pain,
perplexity, and grief to the two friends now, even amid the
fierce and wild work of that eventful 10th of February.

<h3>
CHAPTER LVI.
<br /><br />
THE BATTLE OF KIRBEKAN.
</h3>

<p>
On the night before this brilliant encounter the greatest
enthusiasm prevailed in the ranks of General Earle's column
at the prospect of a brush with the enemy at last, after an
advance of eighteen most weary miles, which had occupied
them no less than twenty days, such was the terrible nature
of the country to be traversed by stream and desert.
As a fine Scottish ballad has it:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'With painful march across the sand<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How few, though strong, they come,<br />
  Some thinking of the clover fields<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the happy English home;<br />
  And some whose graver features speak<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Them children of the North,<br />
  Of the golden whin on the Lion Hill<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That crouches by the Forth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  ''Tis night, and through the desert air<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pibroch's note screams shrill,<br />
  Then dies away&mdash;the bugle sounds&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all is deathly still,<br />
  Save now and then a soldier starts<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As through the midnight air<br />
  A sudden whistle tells him that<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scouts of death are there!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At half-past five in the morning, after a meagre and
hurried breakfast&mdash;the last meal that many were to partake
of on earth&mdash;the column got under arms and took its march
straight inland over a very rocky district for more than a
mile, while blood-red and fiery the vast disc of the sun
began to appear above the far and hazy horizon.
</p>

<p>
Of the scene of these operations very little is known.
Lepsius, in his learned work published in 1844, writes of
the ruins of Ben Naga, now called Mesaurat el Kerbegan,
lying in a valley of that name, in a wild and sequestered
place, where no living thing is seen but the hippopotami
swimming amid the waters of the Nile.
</p>

<p>
Taking ground to the left for about half a mile the
column struck upon the caravan track that led to Berber,
and then the enemy came in sight, led by the Sheikhs
Moussa Abu Hagil, Ali Wad, Aussein, and others, holding
a rocky position, where their dark heads were only visible,
popping up from time to time as seen by the field-glasses.
</p>

<p>
It was intended that the Monassir tribe, the murderers of
Donald Stewart and his party, should, if possible, be
surrounded and cut off; but they were found to be entrenched
and prepared for a desperate resistance on lofty ground near
the Shukuk Pass on a ridge of razor-backed hills, commanding
a gorge which lies between the latter and the Nile, and
the entrance to which they had closed by a fort and walls
loopholed for musketry.
</p>

<p>
'The Black Watch and Staffordshire will advance in
skirmishing order!' was the command of General Earle.
</p>

<p>
Six companies of the Highlanders and four of the latter
corps now extended on both flanks at a run.  The Hussars
galloped to the right, while two companies of the Staffordshire,
with two guns, were left to protect the boats in the
river, the hospital corps, the stores, and spare ammunition.
</p>

<p>
This order was maintained till the companies of skirmishers
gradually, and firing with admirable coolness and precision,
worked their way towards the high rocks in their front.
While closing in with the enemy, whose furious fusillade
enveloped the dark ridge in white smoke, streaked by
incessant flashes of red fire, men were falling down on every
hand with cries to God for help or mercy, and some, it
might be, with a fierce and bitter malediction.
</p>

<p>
There was no time to think, for the next bullet might
floor the thinker: it was the supreme moment which tries
the heart of the bravest; but every officer and man felt that
he must do his duty at all hazards.  Bullets sang past,
thudded in silvery stars on the rocks, cut the clothing, or
raised clouds of dust; comrades and dear friends were going
down fast, as rifles were tossed up and hands were lifted
heavenward&mdash;as, more often, men fell in death, in blood
and agony; but good fortune seemed to protect the
untouched, and then came the clamorous and tiger-like longing
to close in, to grapple with, to get within grasp of the foe!
</p>

<p>
In this spirit Roland went on, but keeping his skirmishers
well in hand, till they reached the high rocks in front, when
they rushed between or over them; and there Colonel Eyre,
a noble, veteran officer, and remarkably handsome man,
who, though a gentleman by birth, had risen from the ranks
in the Crimea&mdash;then as now conspicuous for his bravery&mdash;fell
at the head of his beloved South Staffordshire while
attacking the second ridge, 'where, behind some giant
boulders, the Sheikh Moussa Abu Hagil was with his
Robatat tribe&mdash;the most determined of the Arab race.'
</p>

<p>
The good Colonel was pausing for a moment beside two
of his wounded men.  'Colonel Eyre took one of them by
the hand,' wrote an officer whom we are tempted to quote,
'to comfort him a little.  A minute after he turned to me
and said: "I am a dead man!"  I saw a mark below his
shoulder, and said: "No, you are not."  He looked at me
for a second, and said: "Lord, have mercy upon me&mdash;God
help my poor wife!" ... He was dead in a minute after
he was hit, and did not appear to suffer, the shock being so
great.  The bullet entered the right breast, and came out
under the left shoulder.'
</p>

<p>
Like a roaring wave the infuriated Staffordshire went on,
and then the Robatat tribe were assailed by two companies
of the Highlanders, led by their Colonel and General Earle
in person.  'The Black Watch advanced over rocks and
broken ground upon the Koppies,' says Lord Wolseley's
very brief despatch, 'and, after having by their fire in the
coolest manner driven off a rush of the enemy, stormed the
position under a heavy fire.'
</p>

<p>
But desperate was the struggle prior to this.  The Arabs,
from the cover of every rock and boulder, poured in a fire
with the most murderous precision, while our soldiers flung
themselves headlong at any passage or opening they found,
no matter how narrow or steep.
</p>

<p>
Like wild tigers in their lair, the Arabs fought at bay,
having everywhere the advantage of the ground, and inspired
by a fury born of fanaticism and religious rancour, resolute
to conquer or die; but in spite of odds and everything, our
soldiers stormed rock after rock, and fastness after fastness,
working their way on by bayonet and bullet, the Black
Watch on the left, the old 38th on the right, upward and
onward, over rocks slippery with dripping blood, over the
groaning, the shrieking, the dying, and the dead.
</p>

<p>
Here fell Wilton and merry Dick Mostyn, both mortally
wounded, rolling down the rocks to die in agony; and to
Roland it was evident that Jack Elliot was bitterly intent
on throwing his life away if he could, for he rushed, sword
in hand, at any loophole in the rocks from whence a puff of
smoke or flash of fire spirted out.
</p>

<p>
But brilliant as was the rush of the Staffordshire, climbing
with their hands and feet, it was almost surpassed by the
advance of the Highlanders, for in the <i>élan</i> with which they
went on every man seemed as if inspired by the advice of
General Brackenbury when he said: 'Take your heart and
throw it among the enemy, as Douglas did that of King
Robert Bruce, and follow it with set teeth determined to
win!'
</p>

<p>
When General Earle ordered the left half-battalion of the
Highlanders to advance by successive rushes, they went
forward with a ringing cheer and with pipers playing 'The
Campbells are coming,' and in another moment the scarlet
coats and green kilts, led by Wauchop of Niddry, had
crowned the ridge, rolling the soldiers of the Mahdi down
the rocks before their bayonets in literal piles that never
rose again, and then it was that Colonel Coveny, one of
their most popular officers, fell.
</p>

<p>
Roland felt proud of his regiment, the old South Staffordshire,
but when he saw the tartans fluttering on the crest,
and heard the pipes set up their pæan of victory, all his
heart went forth to the Highlanders, who, ere these
successive rushes were carried out, had been attacked by a
most resolute band of the enemy, armed with long spears
and trenchant swords, led by a standard-bearer clad in a
long Darfour shirt of mail.
</p>

<p>
The latter, the Sheikh Moussa Abu Hagil, was shot, and
as his body went rolling down, the holy standard was seized
in succession by three men of resolute valour, who all
perished successively in the same manner.  Some of this
band now rushed away towards the Nile to escape the storm
of Highland bullets, but were there met by a company of the
Staffordshire and shot down to a man.
</p>

<p>
Within the koppie stormed by the Highlanders was a
stone hut full of Arabs, who, though surrounded by
victorious troops, defiantly refused to surrender.  General
Earle, a veteran Crimean officer of the old 49th, or
Hertfordshire, now rashly approached it, though warned by a
sergeant of the Black Watch to beware, and was immediately
shot dead.
</p>

<p>
An entrance was found to be impossible, so securely was
the door barricaded.  Then the edifice was set on fire by
the infuriated Highlanders, breached by powder, and all the
Arabs within it were shot down or burned alive.
</p>

<p>
The enemy now fled on all hands, while the chivalrous
Buller, with a squadron of the 19th Hussars, captured the
camp three miles in rear of their position, and Brackenbury,
as senior officer, assumed the command.
</p>

<p>
Our casualties were eighty-seven of all ranks killed and
wounded; those of the enemy it was impossible to estimate,
as only seventeen were taken alive, but their dead covered
all the position, and an unknown number perished in the
Nile.
</p>

<p>
Untouched, after that terrible conflict of five consecutive
hours, Roland Lindsay and Jack Elliot grasped each other's
hands in warmth and gratitude when they sheathed their
swords and felt that their ghastly work was done.
</p>

<p>
The subsequent day was devoted to quiet and rest, and on
the field, under a solitary palm tree, the remains of General
Earle, Colonels Eyre, Coveny, and all who had fallen
with them, were reverently interred, without any special
mark to attract the attention of the dwellers in the desert.
</p>

<p>
After all this, Brigadier Brackenbury was about to march
in the direction of Abu Hammed, when unexpected instructions
from the vacillating British Government reached Lord
Wolseley from London, and the river column was ordered
to fall back on the camp at Korti, a task of no small
difficulty; and though a handful of men under Sir Charles
Wilson did reach Khartoum, as we all know, the movement
was achieved too late, and, cruelly betrayed, Gordon had
perished in the midst of his fame.

<h3>
CHAPTER LVII.
<br /><br />
THE SICK CONVOY.
</h3>

<p>
Repeatedly Jack Elliot thanked Heaven that his comrades
in the regiment had not got hold of his wretched story&mdash;that
he and his young wife had quarrelled&mdash;were actually
separated, and that she had run away from him because of
some other woman, as he knew well that but garbled versions
of the comedies or tragedies in the lives of our friends
generally reach us.
</p>

<p>
The movements of the column were now so abrupt, and,
for a time, undecided, that no telegram in reply to his
message reached Roland from Edinburgh, and ere long he
had a new source of anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Enteric fever, that ailment which proved so fatal to many
of our troops during this disastrous and useless war, fastened
upon poor Jack Elliot, and the column had barely reached
the camp at Korti when he was 'down' with it, as the
soldiers phrased it, and very seriously so&mdash;all the more
seriously, no doubt, that the tenor of Mr. M'Wadsett's
postscript left such a doubt on his mind as to the plans and
movements of Maude.
</p>

<p>
His head felt as if weighted with lead&mdash;but hot lead; he
had an appalling thirst, and was destitute of all appetite even
for delicacies, and the latter were not plentiful, certainly, in
our camp at Korti.
</p>

<p>
If he survived, which he thought was almost impossible,
he believed that he could never, never forget what he
endured in the so-called camp there&mdash;first, the languor and
disinclination for work, duty, exercise, even for thinking;
the pains in his limbs; his dry, brown tongue, that rattled
in his mouth; mental and bodily debility; and all the other
signs of his ailment, produced by exposure, by midnight
dew, and the bad, brackish water of the desert.
</p>

<p>
Roland&mdash;of a hardier nature, perhaps&mdash;was unwearying in
his care of him, and thrice daily with his own hands gave
him the odious prescribed draught&mdash;hydrochloric acid,
tincture of orange, and so forth, diluted in Nile water&mdash;while
the once strong, active, and muscular Jack was weak as a
baby.
</p>

<p>
Roland greatly feared he would die on his hands, and
hailed with intense satisfaction an order by which he was
personally detailed to take a detachment of certain sick
and wounded, including Jack Elliot, down the Nile to Lower
Egypt.
</p>

<p>
In his tent, he was roused from an uneasy dream that he
was again lying at the bottom of the Kelpie's Cleugh at
Earlshaugh, by an orderly sergeant, who brought him this
welcome command about dawn, and noon saw him, with a
small flotilla of boats freighted with pain and suffering, take
his leave of the South Staffordshire and begin his journey
down the Nile, <i>viâ</i> New Dongola, the cataracts at Ambigol
and elsewhere, by Wady-Halfa and other points where
temporary hospitals or halting-places were established.
</p>

<p>
Day by day the boats with their melancholy loads, sometimes
by oars, at others with canvas set, had dropped down
the Nile between barren shores overlooked by wild and
sterile mountains, where the sick were almost stunned
occasionally by the harsh yells of the watchful Arabs
echoing from rocks and caves! and, after turning a sharp angle,
Roland suddenly saw the island of Phite, with all its
numerous temples, before his flotilla, and as there was a
considerable flood in the river the cataract there became a
source of anxiety to him, and rather abated the interest with
which he might otherwise have surveyed the scene around
him.
</p>

<p>
'Shellal!  Shellal!' (the Cataract! the Cataract!) he heard
the yells of the naked Arabs, who hovered on the banks
expecting a catastrophe, which they would have beheld with
savage joy.
</p>

<p>
The soldiers held their breath and hung on their suspended
oars, the blades of which dripped and flashed like
gold in the sheen of the setting sun; yet the boats glided
down the foaming rapid without a sound other than the rush
of the water; then came a sudden calm, an amazing
combination of light and colour on shore, and isle, and stream,
with the rays of the moon, in the blue zenith, conflicting
with those of the sun at the horizon.
</p>

<p>
'On either side,' wrote one who was there, 'walls of
overhanging rock shut in the river, standing in pious
guardianship around the sacred isle.  Beneath their frowning
blackness lapped and flowed a shining expanse of water
stained with crimson in the sunset's glow, in which a line of
tall and plumy palms were bending in the wind; to the east,
the Libyan sands poured in a golden stream through every
cleft and fissure in the darkling hills; and overhead, and all
about, floated a splendour of reddening fire.  From their
station they seemed to look straight into the very heart of
the sunset when all the west had burst into sudden flames of
fire.  The freshening wind tossed them in uncertain rise and
fall; the melancholy sound of the distant cataract, and now
and then the cry of some night bird cut sharply through
the stillness of the hour.  An immense sense of loneliness
brooded over the empty temples and adjacent isles abandoned
by their forgotten gods, whose sculptured faces gazed
mournfully out from the crumbling walls, then flushed with
the supreme splendour of the dying day.
</p>

<p>
A few miles further down, the Isle of Flowers, with all its
wondrous vegetation, and the many black rocks of Assouan
rising from a medley of dust, Roman ruins and feathery
palms were left astern; and of the long, long downward
journey some 450 miles were mastered, after which lay nearly
the same distance to Cairo.
</p>

<p>
Often had the boats to pause in their downward way,
while the melancholy duty was performed of burying those
whose journey in life was over, by the river bank, uncoffined,
in nameless and unrecorded graves, where the ibis stalks
among the tall reeds, and the scaly crocodile dozes amid the
ooze.
</p>

<p>
And as the boat in which he lay under an awning glided
down the Nile Jack Elliot was often in a species of stupor,
and muttered at times of his boyish days at the High School
of Edinburgh; of the brawling Tweed when he had been
wont to fish at Braidielee; of matches at Aldershot, and
clearing the hurdles in the Long Valley; but he was most
often a boy, a lad again in his fevered dreams, and seeking
birds' nests among the bonnie Lammermuirs, feeling the
pleasant breeze that came over the braes of the Merse,
while the sun shone on the pools and thickets of the Eye
and the Leader; but of Maude, strange to say, or their
mysterious separation, no word escaped him, till he became
conscious, and then Roland would hear him muttering as
he kissed her photo:
</p>

<p>
'Where are you, my darling?  Shall I ever look upon
your face again?'
</p>

<p>
And with a wasted and trembling hand he would consign
the soft leather case to the breast of his tattered and faded
tunic.  He was so weak, so utterly debilitated that sometimes
he shed involuntary tears&mdash;a sight that filled Roland
with infinite pity and commiseration, and a dread each day
that he might have to leave Jack, as he had left others, in a
lonely tomb by the river-side.
</p>

<p>
Jack, poor fellow, was dwelling generally in a land of
shadows; familiar scenes and faces came and receded, and
loved voices came and sank curiously in his ear, while his
apparently dying eyes and lips pled vainly for one kiss of his
sunny-haired Maude to sweeten the bitter draught of that
death which seemed so close and nigh.
</p>

<p>
But he was still struggling between life and eternity, when
in the ruddy haze Roland hailed the purple outlines of the
Pyramids in the Plain of Ghizeh, the ridge of the Jebel
Mokattam, the distant minarets and the magnificent citadel
of Cairo.
</p>

<p>
On reaching the Kasr-el-Nil Barracks, Roland was ordered
to be attached for duty purposes to a regiment quartered
there till further orders, as no more troops were proceeding
up the Nile.
</p>

<p>
Though the battle of Hasheen was to be fought and won,
and the lamentable fiasco of Macneill's zereba to occur at
Suakim, the war was deemed virtually over, as the cause
for it had collapsed by Gordon's betrayal and the fall of
Khartoum.
</p>

<p>
With the general advance of the expedition under Lord
Wolseley to rescue Gordon, our story has only had a certain
connection&mdash;a mission undertaken far too late, but during
which the mind at home was kept at fever-heat by news
from that burning seat of strife, recording the sufferings of
our soldiers, and the bloody but victorious battles with the
Mahdists, till the dark and terrible tidings came, that just as
Wilson's column was ready to join Gordon, who had sent
his steamers to Metemneh to meet him&mdash;Khartoum, after a
defence perhaps unsurpassed in the annals of peril and
glory, had fallen by storm and treachery, and the people of
Britain were left to wonder, and in doubt, whether a
stupendous blunder or an unpardonable crime had been
perpetrated.

<h3>
CHAPTER LVIII.
<br /><br />
IN THE SHOUBRAH GARDENS.
</h3>

<p>
Roland lost no time in telegraphing home for news of the
missing ones, but received none; Mr. M'Wadsett was
absent from town, so he and Jack Elliot, who was far from
recovery yet, had to take patience and wait, they scarcely
knew for what.  One fact was too patent, that both Hester
and Maude had disappeared&mdash;one too probably in penury
and the other in an agony of grief and shame.  It was not
even known, apparently, whether they were together.
</p>

<p>
They had vanished, and, save a cheque or two cashed by
Jack's bankers, left no trace of how or when; and a chilling
fear crept over the hearts of both men as to what might
have happened&mdash;illness, poverty, unthought-of snares, even
death itself.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, 'the shadow, cloaked from head to foot, who
keeps the keys of all the creeds,' was hovering perilously
near Jack, for whom Roland procured quarters in a pleasant
house in the beautiful Shoubrah Road, near Cairo&mdash;a broad
but shady avenue formed of noble sycamores, the 'Rotten
Row' of the city, and day followed day somewhat
monotonously now, though a letter dated some weeks back from his
legal friend of Thistle Court gave Roland some occasion for
gratifying thought.
</p>

<p>
'If you can return,' it ran, 'must I remind you that now
Earlshaugh is unoccupied; the land so far neglected, and
the tenants well-nigh forgotten; the rents are accumulating
at your bankers', but no good is done to anyone.  Your
proper place and position is your own again; justice has
restored your birthright; so come home at once and act
wisely&mdash;home, my dear friend, and you shall have such a
welcome as Earlshaugh has not seen since your father came
back after the Crimean War.'
</p>

<p>
Pondering over this letter and on what the future might
have in store, Roland was one afternoon idling over a
cigarette in the gardens of the Shoubrah Palace, an edifice
which rises from the bank of the Nile.  On one side are
pleasant glimpses of the latter, with its palm-clad banks and
sparkling villages; on the other a tract of brilliantly tinted
cultivation, and beyond it the golden sands of the desert,
the shifting hillocks they form, and the gray peaks of several
pyramids.
</p>

<p>
The gardens, surpassingly beautiful and purely Oriental
in character, are entered by long and winding walks of
impenetrable shade, from which we emerge on open spaces
that team with roses, with gilded pavilions and painted
kiosks.  'Arched walks of orange-trees with the fruit and
flowers hanging over your head lead to fountains,' says a
Jewish writer, 'or to some other garden court, where myrtles
border beds of tulips, and you wander on mosaic walks of
polished pebbles; a vase flashes amid a group of dark
cypresses, and you are invited to repose under a Syrian
walnut-tree by a couch or summer-house.  The most striking
picture, however, of this charming retreat is a lake
surrounded by light cloisters of white marble, and in the
centre a fountain of crocodiles carved in the same material.'
</p>

<p>
Lulled by the heat, by the drowsy hum made by the
sound of many carriages filled with harem beauties or
European ladies rolling to and fro on the adjacent
Shoubrah Road, with the ceaseless patter of hoofs, as
mounted Cairene dandies and our cavalry officers rode in
the same gay promenade, Roland reclined on a marble seat,
lit another cigarette, and watched the giant flowers of the
Egyptian lotus in the little lake, blue and white, that sink
when the sun sets, but open and rise when it is shining, till
suddenly he saw a young lady appear, who was evidently
idling in the gardens like himself.
</p>

<p>
He could see that she was a European.  With one glove
drawn off, showing a hand the pure whiteness of which
contrasted with her dark dress, she was playing with the water
of a red marble fountain that fell sparkling into the lakelet,
not ten yards from where he was seated, unseen by her.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly his figure, in his undress uniform, caught
her eye; she turned and looked full at him, as if
spellbound.
</p>

<p>
'Roland!' she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'Hester&mdash;good heavens, can it be?&mdash;Hester, and <i>here</i>!'
said he.
</p>

<p>
Hester she was; he sprang to her side, and they took
each other's hands, both for a moment in dumb confusion
and bewilderment.  At the moment of this meeting and
before recognition, even when hovering near him, and he
had been all unconscious of who the tall and slender girl in
mourning really was, she had been thinking of him, and as
she had often thought&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'I loved Roland all my life&mdash;better than my own soul;
but such a love as mine is too often only its own best
reward; and many a sore heart like mine learns that never in
this world is it measured to us again as we have meted it
out.'
</p>

<p>
Thus bitterly had the girl been pondering, when she
found herself suddenly face to face with the subject of her
reverie, and, in spite of herself, a little cloud was blended
with the astonishment her eyes expressed.
</p>

<p>
'Hester&mdash;what mystery is this?  And are you not glad
to see me?' he asked impetuously.
</p>

<p>
'Glad&mdash;oh, Roland! glad indeed, and that you escaped
that dreadful day at Kirbekan!' she replied, while her eyes
became humid now.
</p>

<p>
'God bless you, my darling!' he exclaimed, as all his
soul seemed suddenly to go forth to her, and he would have
drawn her to him; but she thought of Annot Drummond,
and fell back a pace.  'Hester,' said he upbraidingly, 'will
you not accord me one kiss, darling?'
</p>

<p>
She grew pale now, for she feared that her welcome had
been more cordial than he had any right to expect; but the
circumstances were peculiar, their place and mode of meeting
alike strange and unexpected; but it was impossible for
her not to guess, to read in his eyes, in fact, all the tender
passion of love, esteem, and kinship that filled his heart for
her now.
</p>

<p>
'How well you are looking, Hester, after all you must
have suffered&mdash;some of the old rose's hue is back to your
cheek, darling.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't speak thus, Roland&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;' she faltered.
</p>

<p>
'Why not, Hester?  You loved me, I know, even as I
loved you.'
</p>

<p>
'Before that beautiful little hypocrite and adventuress
came,' said she, with quiet bitterness, 'I certainly did love
you, Roland&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'And love me still, Hester?'
</p>

<p>
'Do I look as if I had let the worm in the bud feed on
my damask cheek?' said she, with a little gasping laugh;
'has my hair grown thin or white?  How vain you are,
Cousin Roland!'
</p>

<p>
'No, Hester' (how he loved to utter her name!);
'though I admit to having been a hopeless and thoughtless
fool&mdash;no worse; but, forgive me, dear Hester; I ask you
in the name of your good old father, who so loved us
both, and in memory of our pleasant past at Merlwood.'
</p>

<p>
She made no answer; but her downcast eyes were full
of tears; her breast was heaving, and her lips were
quivering now.
</p>

<p>
'It ought not to be hard to forgive you, Roland, as you
never said, even in that pleasant past, that you loved me;
and yet, perhaps&mdash;but I must go now,' she said, interrupting
herself, as she turned round wearily and vaguely.
</p>

<p>
'Go where?' he asked.  'But how came you to be
here&mdash;here in Cairo&mdash;and whither are you going?'
</p>

<p>
'To where I reside,' she replied, with a soft smile; for,
with all her love for him, and with all her supreme joy at
meeting him again thus safe and sound, and in a manner so
unprecedentedly peculiar, she was not disposed quite to
strike her colours and yield at once.
</p>

<p>
'Reside!' thought Roland, with a flush of anger in his
heart; 'as companion, governess, nursing sister, or&mdash;what?'
</p>

<p>
'To where I reside with Maude,' she added, almost
reading his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
'Is Maude here, too?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; we came together in quest of you and Jack.  Oh! where
is he?&mdash;well and safe, too, I am sure, or you would
not be looking so bright.  Maude left her home under a
mistake&mdash;the victim of a conspiracy, hatched, as we know
now, by that wretched creature Sharpe.'
</p>

<p>
'And she is here&mdash;here in Cairo?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'This seems miraculous!'
</p>

<p>
'Come with me to Maude.'
</p>

<p>
'And then to Jack&mdash;to poor Jack, whom the sight of her
beloved face will surely make well and strong again.'
</p>

<p>
And, as people in a dream, in another minute they were
in a cab&mdash;for cabs are now to be had in the city of the
Caliphs and the Mamelukes&mdash;and were bowling towards
one of the stately squares in the European quarter through
strangely picturesque streets of lofty, latticed, and painted
houses, richly carved as Gothic shrines, where, by day, the
many races that make up the population of Cairo in their
bright and varied costumes throng on foot, on horse or
donkey-back; and where, by night, rope-dancers, conjurers,
fire-eaters, and tumblers, with sellers of fruit, flowers,
sherbet, and coffee, make up a scene of noise and bustle beyond
description; and now certainly, with Hester suddenly
conjured up by his side, Roland felt, we say, as if in a dream
wild and sudden as anything in the 'Arabian Nights.'
</p>

<p>
Does love once born lie dormant to live again?
</p>

<p>
Judging by his own experience, he thought so, with
truth.
</p>

<p>
More than once when he had gone forth into the world
with his regiment he had almost forgotten the little Hester
as she had been to him, a sweet, piquante, and dainty
figure amid the groves of Merlwood, and in the background
of his boyish days; then in his soldier's life, she would anon
flit across the vista of memory, fondly and pleasantly, till he
learned to love her (ere that other came, that Circe with her
cup and the dangerous charm of novelty); and now all his
old passion sprang into existence, holding his heart in its
purity and strength as if it had never wandered from
her&mdash;tender, unselfish, and true as his boyish love had been in
the past time; yet just then, by her side, and with her hand
within grasp of his own, he felt his lips but ill unable to
express all he thought and felt, and his fear of&mdash;<i>the refusal</i>
that might come.
</p>

<p>
Then he was about to see his dearly-loved sister Maude;
but his joy thereat was clouded by the dread and knowledge
that poor Jack's life was trembling in the balance.

<h3>
CHAPTER LIX.
<br /><br />
CONCLUSION.
</h3>

<p>
The fond white arms of Maude were around Jack, his
head was pillowed on her breast; so the young pair were
once more together, and she had, of course, installed
herself as his nurse.
</p>

<p>
Oh, how haggard, wan, wasted, and changed he was!
</p>

<p>
He lay quiet, motionless, and happy, if 'weak as a cat,'
he said, with the hum of the great city of Cairo coming
faintly through the latticed windows that overlooked the
vast Uzbekyeh Square and its gardens, whilom a marsh, and
now covered with stately trees, under which are cafés for
the sale of coffee, sherbet, and punch, where bands play in
the evenings, and Franks and Turks may be seen with
Europeans in their Nizam dresses, and the Highlander in
his white jacket and tartan kilt.
</p>

<p>
How delightful it was to have her dear caresses again&mdash;to
feel her soft breath on his faded cheek; all seemed so
new, so strange, that he almost feared the delicious spell
might break, and he, awaking, find himself again in his
grass hut at Korti, or gliding down the Nile in the whaleboat
of the old Staffordshire, with Arabs to repel, rocks to
avoid, and cataracts to shoot with oar and pole.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Jack,' said Maude, for the twentieth time, 'forgive
and pardon me for doubting you; but that woman&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'A vile plot&mdash;backed up by a forged letter!  My little
Maude, it would not have borne a moment's investigation!'
</p>

<p>
'I know&mdash;I know now; but I was so terrified&mdash;so
crushed&mdash;so lonely!  And then, think of the days and
nights of horror and agony I underwent.  The woman
dying of a street accident in the Infirmary of Edinburgh,
signed a confession of her story&mdash;that she was the bribed
agent of Sharpe's plot.  I wrote all about it, but you never
got my letter.'
</p>

<p>
'And this was "the startling news" that made you so
suddenly leave Edinburgh?'
</p>

<p>
'To come here in search of you.  Oh, Jack!  I was mad
to doubt you; but you would quite pardon me if you knew
all I have undergone.  Shall I ever forget the night she
came&mdash;the night of that aimless flight south&mdash;aimless, save
to avoid you&mdash;but ending at York?  Oh never, Jack, if I
lived a thousand years!  I now know that it takes a
great deal to kill some people; yet I think that, but for
dear, affectionate Hester, I could not have lived very long
with that awful and never-ceasing pain gnawing at my
heart.'
</p>

<p>
Jack raised her quivering face between his tremulous
hands, and looked into it fondly and yearningly.  How full
of affection it seemed&mdash;so softly radiant with shy and lovely
blushes, while her eyes of forget-me-not blue never, even in
the past, shone with the love-light that illumined them now,
when sufferings were past and their memory becoming
fainter.
</p>

<p>
'How long&mdash;how long it seems since we separated, and
without a farewell, Jack!'
</p>

<p>
'A day sometimes seems an age&mdash;ay, even a day, when
matters of the heart are concerned.'
</p>

<p>
'And a minute or two may undo the work of years&mdash;yea,
of a lifetime.  But you must get well and strong, Jack, for
the homeward voyage.  In a few days we shall have you
laughing among us again; and you will see what a careful
little nurse I shall prove.'
</p>

<p>
Jack, withal, feared just then that there was but little
laughter left for him on earth; yet their reunion and the
presence of Maude acted as a wonderful charm upon him,
and from her loving little hands, instead of those of a stolid
hospital orderly, he now took his prescribed 'baby food' as
he called it&mdash;beef-tea, eggs beat up in milk, and port wine
elixir, with the odious 'diluted hydrochloric acid, one
drachm, and of quinine, eight drachms,' as ordered by the
medical staff.
</p>

<p>
But he rallied rapidly, though Maude's heart beat
painfully when occasionally a ray of sunshine stole into the
room through the picturesque lattice-wood windows (which
in Cairo had not been superseded by glass) and rested on
his face, and she saw how pale and wan, if peaceful and
bright, the latter was now: and then if he spoke too much,
she placed her white hands on his lips, or silenced them
more sweetly but quite as effectually.
</p>

<p>
Hester, when she first saw Jack Elliot, little imagined that
he would recover so rapidly.  She had thought of Maude
and then of her own father.
</p>

<p>
'Strange it is,' pondered the girl, 'that when one sorrow
comes upon us&mdash;a shock unexpectedly&mdash;we seem to see the
gradual approach of another, and so realize its bitterness
before it becomes an actual fact.  Thus I felt, long before
poor papa died, that I should be alone and penniless in
the world.'
</p>

<p>
'Hester!' exclaimed Roland, softly but upbraidingly, as
she said something of this kind to him.
</p>

<p>
'Well, Roland,' said Hester, 'no one seemed to care where
I went or what became of me; all the world was indifferent
to me; I had lost all interest and saw no beauty
in it.'
</p>

<p>
He had both her hands in his now, and was gazing into
her white-lidded and long-lashed dark-blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
Then, as eye met eye, each saw a strange but alluring
expression in the other&mdash;the past, the present, and future
all mingled and combined&mdash;an expression of a nature deep
and indescribable.
</p>

<p>
We do not mean to rehearse all that Roland said then.
If no woman can without some emotion hear a tale of love,
especially if told so powerfully as Roland was telling it then,
we may well believe how Hester's heart responded; and he
held her in his embrace, and kissed her again and again as
a man only kisses the girl he loves, and, more than all, the
one he hopes to make his wife.
</p>

<p>
So everything is said to come in time to those who
wait.
</p>

<p>
They were together again&mdash;together at last&mdash;and the
outer world and all other things thereof seemed to glide
away from them, leaving only love and peace and rest
behind&mdash;love and trust with the radiance of light!
</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
